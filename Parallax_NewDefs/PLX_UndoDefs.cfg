    @RESULTS
    {
		!MohoSrfLanded = At least you will have a nice tan when you get home.
		
		!IkeSrfLanded = You really want to leave some footsteps, but the low gravity means making a deep imprint isn't easy.
		!IkeSrfLanded = Everything is grey. You're not sure if it really is grey or if you're slowly losing your colour vision.
	
		!IkeInSpaceLowMidlands = Description: "It's the grey bit between the lighter grey bit and the black bit". Hopefully that's enough.
	
		!LaytheSrfLandedDunes = You wonder if you could swim to the next island from here.
		!LaytheSrfLandedShores = This would make a great beach resort!

    {
        !MohoSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be trying to escape.
		
        !LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The Goo twists into strange and frightening forms, possibly due to a strong magnetic field on this moon.

{
    @RESULTS
    {
		!IkeSrfLandedMidlands = You find a green mineral in the soil.
		!IkeSrfLandedMidlands = The dusty ground here has neither the stickiness of the highlands nor the darkness of the lowlands.
		
		!LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The soil here contains no immediately identifiable organic chemicals.
		!LaytheSrfLandedShores = Is this..... sand?
		!LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland = Thirsty from your long trip, you take a sip of the sample, only to find that it's the most awful water you ever tasted.

{
    @RESULTS
    {
		!MohoInSpaceLow = Moho's surface has little in the way of distinguishing features, even viewed close-up through the telescope.
		
		!IkeInSpaceLow = There are some dark regions of the surface, and some light ones, too!
		
		!LaytheInSpaceLow = The tiny islands look lost amid Laythe's enormous ocean, but the terrain looks rather inviting for mounting a surface expedition.
		!LaytheInSpaceLowDunes = Up close the ocean looks blue, very blue.

{
    @RESULTS
    {
		!MohoSrfLanded = X-ray analysis of the surface of Moho reveals a number of low-iron basaltic minerals which appear to have been formed under extremely reducing conditions.
		
		!IkeSrfLanded = A detailed x-ray diffraction analysis is conducted on this sample of Ike's surface.
		
		!LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Several interesting tholin compounds, simple organic molecules, are discovered in this sample from Laythe's islands.
		!LaytheSrfLandedShores = Some basaltic minerals are present in this sample, an indication that some kind of volcanic or other geologic activity created these island chains.

{
    @RESULTS
    {
		!LaytheSrfLanded = Trace concentrations of methane, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen cyanide are detected among the more abundant ammonia and carbon dioxide.
		
		!LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Laythe's inexplicably high temperatures prevent any ice cap formation. As such, the core sample collected here resembles those at more equatorial latitudes.
		!LaytheSrfLandedPoles = No signs of biological activity are observed in this sample, but several organic and nitrogen compounds are detected, raising hopes for the discovery of some form of life on Laythe.
		
		!LaytheSrfLandedShores = The sandy core sample has high concentrations of salt and ammonia, this raises the question of whether any organic nitrogen compounds are formed in Laythe's soil.
		
		!LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Very slight concentrations of amino acids are detected in this core sample.
		!LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Incubation in the sample container may help determine whether the various gases detected in this core sample are geological or biological in nature.
