		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_MohoSrfLanded = You wonder what sort of geological process could've created those metal hex pillars.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_MohoSrfLanded = The Goo has formed into a hexagon.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_MohoSrfLanded = You try to take a sample from one of the hexagonal pillars, but it's extremely hard. It's probably made of metal.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_crewReport_IkeSrfLanded = The colossal red crystals outside make for an interesting sight, to say the least. You wonder how Ike got like this.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_IkeSrfLanded1 = You decide to try climbing on one of the crystals despite Mission Control's insistence that it could puncture your suit.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_IkeSrfLanded2 = You already liked Ike before, but now you really like Ike! These huge crystals are amazing!
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_IkeInSpaceLow = You think you can see jagged red shapes down on the surface below. What could those be?
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_IkeSrfLanded = You chip off a few chunks of crystal and deposit them in a bag. You wonder if Ike is just an enormous geode.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_crewReport_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Did they put something in your snacks?
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_crewReport_LaytheSrfLandedShores = The exterior temperature reading is in conflict with the vibrant landscape you see out the window. Are those oceans even water at all?
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_crewReport_LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland = This landscape is completely alien. It's unlike anywhere on Kerbin.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_crewReport_LaytheSrfLandedPeaks = The fields of rolling sandy dunes and giant mushrooms seem endless.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = It's a giant mushroom... Maybe it's friendly!
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_LaytheSrfLandedShores = The soil and the sky are glowing with bioluminescent life. Huge mushrooms the size of trees dot the landscape, and the 'grass' here is as dark as the sand.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland = You suppose you shouldn't have expected warm temperatures and palm trees.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_evaReport_LaytheSrfLandedPeaks = The leathery red caps of alien mushrooms can be seen spanning the landscape for kilometers around you.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The Goo has taken the shape of a mushroom.
		
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = The soil sample here seems to glow in the dark.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_LaytheSrfLandedShores = This wet, sandy substance is burbling with ongoing biological activity. The liquid it's wet with, however, is ammonia- not water.
		#LOC_PLX_SciDef_surfaceSample_LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland = Traces of heavier elements are found in the soil here, but the native life doesn't seem to mind.
		
		
		
		// DMagic Defs
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_scopeScan_MohoInSpaceLow = Moho's surface geology is largely uniform, except for the fact that small, black hexagonal shapes dot the landscape.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_MohoSrfLanded = A sample of one of the hexagonal objects on Moho's surface reveals it to be an iron-nickel alloy, formed under extreme pressure. What it's doing on the surface is anyone's guess.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_scopeScan_IkeInSpaceLow = Red crystals dot the surface of Ike, some enormous and some tiny. This is quite the alien landscape, and not at all what you expected to see. Ike almost resembles a moon-sized geode.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_IkeInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Duna's moon has proven to be just as interesting as its partner. Red crystals dot the landscape, glistening in the sunlight. These photos will make for great press, but the crystals might complicate landing.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_IkeSrfLanded = Detailed x-ray diffraction analysis of one of Ike's smaller crystals reveals it to be corundum, a type of aluminum oxide. This form of corundum is commonly known as ruby.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_scopeScan_LaytheInSpaceLow = Mysteriously, the dark side of Laythe appears to be faintly glowing a shade of pale blue.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_scopeScan_LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The mysterious red circles spotted in these photos look almost like giant mushrooms.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_scopeScan_LaytheInSpaceLowDunes = Red circles dot the landscape. What could those possibly be?
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_LaytheInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Photos taken of Laythe's islands reveal what are unmistakably giant, tree-sized mushrooms. This obviously warrants further study.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Complex organic molecules and clear evidence of ongoing biological activity are detected in the sample.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_LaytheSrfLandedShores = There's no mistaking the clear presence of life in this sample, but it's so soaked with ammonia that nothing should be able to survive. Unless... the native life uses it as a solvent?
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_LaytheSrfLanded = Significant concentrations of organic molecules are detected on Laythe's surface.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_LaytheSrfSplashedOceansAllShallow = Suspended in the water column- er, ammonia column- are massive bioforms resembling kelp.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_LaytheSrfSplashedOceansAllDeep = A deep, rumbling cry vibrates the water. No doubt the call of some massive alien beast. Hopefully, it's not predatory.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_LaytheSrfSplashedShores = A colorful ecosystem characterizes Laythe's shores. In the frigid ammonia-hydrocarbon mixture, colorful bioluminescent creatures swim through kelp-like structures.
		
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedDunes = High concentrations of complex organic molecules are detected despite the abundance of ammonia; molecules which are being continuously replenished. It's pretty clear that Laythe is full of life!
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Even here, life persists in some form. Large, winged creatures appear to be resting nearby, looking up at the aurora above.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedPeaks = A small creature with leathery wings is resting on a nearby mushroom cap, staring at your craft curiously.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedShores = While eel-like creatures swim through the ammonia oceans nearby, long-necked beasts reach out over the shores and catch them in their mouths.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedOceansAll = The ocean floor of Laythe is literally alight with activity. Flashes of light in the core sample seem to be produced by microscopic bioluminescent organisms.
		#LOC_PLX_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_LaytheSrfLandedCraterIsland = This island is home to mostly smaller organisms, likely a product of the reduced resources available here. Largest are the same flying beasts with leathery wings seen elsewhere on Laythe- it's likely they do not live here, but merely take perches atop the mushrooms to rest.
