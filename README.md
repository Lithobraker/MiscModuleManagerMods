Mun_Realism.cfg changes the Mun's orbit and its properties to more accurately reflect the real Moon. These changes would probably make it unstable with Minmus though, so it's recommended to use it with a config that moves Minmus.

Parallax_Rescale_Dynamic.cfg will dynamically read your SigmaDimensions settings to modify Parallax values to maintain the proper terrain textures and scatter distributions at every rescale value.

SunkWorks_CheaperEngines.cfg just makes SunkWorks engines consume less Electric Charge.

USILS_DeepFreeze_Fix.cfg fixes USI-LS's broken DeepFreeze support and enables its cryo freezer to... actually cryo-freeze Kerbals.
