This set of configs is for people who'd like a slightly less hardcore USI Life Support experience, without the fuss of dealing with the jank and randomness of Snacks.

It buffs a few USI-LS parts to be easier to use, and enables USI-LS agroponics parts to manufacture Fertilizer from Ore with no ISRU parts required.
The rate at which Fertilizer is produced is also plenty fast enough to support more Kerbals than you will ever need it to.
However, their conversion of Fertilizer to Supplies is still a significant bottleneck.

The Nom-O-Matic 5000 has been buffed into the Nom-O-Matic 12500, a halved version of the existing Nom-O-Matic 25000.
The configs also add a smaller Nom-O-Matic part to fill an existing gap in Fertilizer production capabilities.

These configs don't change how quickly a Kerbal consumes Supplies or produces Mulch, as that's configurable ingame. I play with Kerbals' supply consumption halved.
