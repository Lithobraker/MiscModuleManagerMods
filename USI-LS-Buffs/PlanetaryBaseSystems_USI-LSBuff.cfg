//Modifies the K&K Planetary Greenhouse to be a much more powerful, self-contained life support part with recycling, ore storage, and mass ore to fertilizer conversion.
//It also buffs the agroponics facility to be able to produce far more Supplies.
//This will help reduce lag, as all you'll need to sustain a large colony is this part, a drill, power generation, and some radiators- saving massively on part count.
//It can also store enough Supplies and Fertilizer to last for ages with its recycler.
//To compensate however, the part has been made substantially heavier and much, MUCH costlier.

//Also buffs the various recyclers included in PBI.

    @title = K&K Planetary Agroponics Module
	@description = The K&K Planetary Agroponics Module, or PAM for short, is a formidable piece of hardware. Through arcane means unknown to all but the engineers who designed it, the PAM is able to cram enough growbeds and storage compartments in it to supply an entire large base on its own- only needing assitance from a drill, radiators and power generators to do its job. It can compost Ore into useful fertilizer, grow loads of plants, and store them- it even has a toaster, and a complimentary minibar! Needless to say, we at K&K Advanced Orbit and Surface Structures are terrified of those engineers, but also very, very proud. Naturally, packing all that stuff into such a small space makes it extremely heavy and pricey.
