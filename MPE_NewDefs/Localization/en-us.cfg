		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Ervo_InSpaceHigh = Ervo's tenuous at best atmosphere seems to produce a lot of charged particles as the Kerbolar wind slams against it, even at this distance, a star's might is clearly displayed.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Ervo_InSpaceLow = There is no detectable magnetic field being generated by Ervo's interior, however, there does seem to be some amount of geologic activity occurring on the surface. Perhaps Ervo's mantle remains molten, while the core has frozen?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Ervo_SrfLanded = No magnetic fields are detected here.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Zore_InSpaceHigh = Scientists have eagerly awaited the results of a magnetometer experiment in the space around Zore, so far at this distance nothing of note seems to be present.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Zore_InSpaceLow = It's weak, but most certainly there! The magnetometer detects a very weak, but steady magnetic dipole emitting from Zore, it could very be that this is confirmation that Zore is the once-molten now-exposed core of a long gone protoplanet.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Zore_SrfLanded = Zore's surface is highly magnetically charged, being so rich in iron and nickel. There are faint magnetic field lines going north-south.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Vant_InSpaceHigh = Vant is, magnetically speaking, very dead. However, there have been meteors found on Kerbin originating from Vant that show that at some point, billions of years ago, Vant did indeed generate a magnetic field. Perhaps very weak residuals of this field still remain on the surface?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Vant_InSpaceLow = No matter how hard the data is scrutinized, there sadly there seems to be no indication that Vant has any magnetic field left to show.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Vant_SrfLanded = Magnetic silence.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Soden_InSpaceHigh = Nothing of note in regards to Soden can be said, however, Soden is most certainly, without a doubt, beyond the heliopause, as the spacecraft definitely passed it on the way out. The radiation of the interstellar medium must be blasting Soden constantly, and perhaps that will influence its magnetic environment.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Soden_InSpaceLow = While Soden does not have much in the way of an atmosphere, there is certainly, an exceptionally faint ionosphere. Its shape and structure is molded by not just Kerbol's winds, but also the interstellar medium. This has tremendous implications for studying how icy dwarf planets and other far-flung objects are impacted by not being shielded by Kerbol's magnetic field.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Soden_SrfLanded = Besides the few charged particles from Kerbol that manage to occasionally produce detectable activity here, there's nothing for the sensor to read.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Havous_InSpaceHigh = Havous has no magnetic field, not that planetary scientists back home were ever holding their breath about that.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Havous_InSpaceLow = There remains no indication of a magnetic field around Havous, however there are some ionized particles being blasted away from Havous' surface by the solar wind. This might imply some subtle amount of cryovolcanism on Havous, but it might also just be that occasionally Havous sublimates some amount of material. 
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Havous_SrfLanded = Ionized particles are occasionally blasted away into space, producing ionized particles.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Edas_InSpace = There is not a hint of magnetic activity in space around Edas, unless of course you count the Sun's.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Edas_SrfLanded = Readings are still consistent with interplanetary space at this solar altitude.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_LintMikey_InSpaceHigh = While 68P is certainly too small to generate a strong magnetic field, it most certainly seems that its coma has some interesting interactions with the solar wind. In fact, there is a very, very faint aurora, visible only in UV light.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = There is a very weak magnetic field around 68P, and this field is likely a remnant of the comet's formation within Kerbol's protoplanetary disk.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_LintMikey_SrfLanded = 68P appears to possess an extremely trace magnetic field, implying that this object- or perhaps, these objects- are exceptionally ancient.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Geito_InSpace = Geito's tail seems to generate some form of magnetic field, it forms a bow shock and wake as Geito travels the Kerbolar System.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Geito_SrfLanded = Being blasted by sunlight at perihelion causes Geito to produce a burst of magnetic activity; followed by years and years of near-total silence.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Crokslev_InSpace = Crokslev has no magnetic field, but with how closely it may interact with the magnetic fields of giant planets, it may very well be that Crokslev's surface or interior have some amount of polarized material.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Crokslev_SrfLanded = Small localized regions of Crokslev produce faint magnetic fields, these may be remnants of its formation or metals that were polarized by the nearby giant planets.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Mracksis_InSpace = Mracksis absolutely has no magnetic field of note, but its red coloration is a result of surface ices interacting with the solar wind, meaning while not directly pushing back on the solar wind, Mracksis still has interesting interactions with it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Mracksis_SrfLanded = That red stuff is not iron oxide; if it were you might be getting a detectable reading from Mracksis.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_KiKi_InSpace = Ki'Ki has no magnetic interactions with Havous or the The Sun, though if it was at some point a comet, it may have at one point in its history.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_KiKi_SrfLanded = Ki'Ki does not seem to be producing a magnetic field.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Kal_InSpace = Honestly, I don't know what we expect from this... Well yeah, I mean, it's important to check but- I mean it's Kal. I know, I know it's just... oh wait. Data is coming back now. Yeah, see? Nothing.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Kal_SrfLanded = Cal is most likely a little lump of water ice and organic molecules, so it doesn't produce a magnetic field.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Flake_InSpace = It would honestly be rather incredible, almost ground breaking, if this little ball of icy fuzz generated a magnetic field, sadly but not surprisingly, it does not.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Flake_SrfLanded = Snowcones don't emit a magnetic field, dummy!
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Lon_InSpace = Lon occasionally seems to get blasted by ion tails streaming off Soden's weak ionosphere, and these tails seem to fly off in a rather chaotic manner. However, Lon itself does not seem to respond with any magnetic or ionic properties of its own.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Lon_SrfLanded = Lon appears to lack any sort of magnetic material.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Archae_InSpaceHigh = Archae, of the two objects in the Ervo System, is less likely to host a magnetic field. So far, it doesn't seem to.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Archae_InSpaceLow = Shockingly, there do seem to be small regions on the surface generating localized magnetic fields, this is similar to activity observed on the Mun, which brings a very strange familiarity to such an alien system.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_Magnetometer_Archae_SrfLanded = Small, isolated regions of Archae are surrounded by weak magnetic fields, indicating the presence of ancient rock left over from the early solar system.
		
		
		
		// Stock Defs (Ported from the base mod)
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_KiKiSrfLandedContactPoint = The rocks here are quite tough, it would seem that the material here was compressed heavily when the two lobes came together. You dread having to tell mission control that you broke your sample drill. However, it would seem that both lobes are very similar in composition, they may have formed from the exact same cloud.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_KiKiSrfLanded = You're able to easily gather a large regolith sample in the microgravity. Ki'Ki's surface is mainly comprised of various ices and tholins.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_KalSrfLandedLowlands = Kal's lowlands have a very diverse surface, you can barely decide on which rock to choose. The variety of ice, rock, and even some metallic material implies that Kal came together from loose material not long after the collision that made Havous into the strange world it is today.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_KalSrfLandedMountains = The material that makes up these large bumps is almost entirely ice. These solid chunks of material might have at one point been moonlets within Havous' rings before merging with Kal as it moved to its present position.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_KalSrfLandedPeaks = This material is flaky and soft, it's definitely material fresh from Havous' rings. You ask mission control if you can build your own personal ring system with this material, only to get an annoyed groan in response.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_FlakeSrfLanded = This region is hard ice, and would be slippery too, if the gravity wasn't so low.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_FlakeSrfLandedIce = These highlands are pure, flaky powder, you make sure to take precautions to ensure the sample doesn't melt instantly. This material is very similar to that found in rings. Flake may have formed from a long gone system of rings around Mracksis.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_LonSrfLanded = There's a strangely high amount of metal flakes in the ice, which accounts for Lon's strange coloration. The origin of this material however simply creates more questions than answers.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_LonSrfLandedCraters = These craters are coated in a layer of rocky dust.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_MracksisSrfLanded = You'd be hard pressed to find something that wasn't tholins here. This raises questions on how such a massive amount of tholins formed.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_MracksisSrfLandedMaria = There's a fair amount of rock in the ice samples here, and the materials are quite compressed too. It's a wonder these impacts didn't form rings or any large moons.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_MracksisSrfLandedIceFields = Part of you is relieved to find an area that isn't so red. This ice may be newer material, maybe even delivered through the same impacts that so visibly scar the surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_MracksisSrfLandedPlanitia = The material here is similar to the majority of Mracksis' surface. It's slightly more compressed here however, this very well could be an impact zone.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_MracksisSrfLandedLesserMare = The material here is similar to the majority of Mracksis' surface. It's slightly more compressed here however, this very well could be an impact zone.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_HavousSrfLanded = This sample is mainly ice, with some trace amounts of rock.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_HavousSrfLandedScar = This area is mostly rocky, but there is still a fair amount of ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_HavousSrfLandedPointZero = This is a region of almost purely metamorphic, rocky material. The deposit was likely a direct result of the impact event, and its presence in the middle of the scar, suggests this was the point of impact.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_HavousSrfLandedGlaciers = The sample is entirely ice. There's a strange absence of rocky material, or even the tholins that seem so common in this region of the solar system. Perhaps the glacier's material recycles somehow.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = This sample is mainly ice, but it's more compressed here.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLanded = This sample is ice, but its been dirtied by darker material. It's a bit sticky.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLandedCrags = This sample is rocky, in fact, it was quite hard to remove.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat = The ice here is compressed, one could reasonably conclude this to be an impact zone.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLandedSmolFlat = The ice here is compressed, one could reasonably conclude this to be an impact zone.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLandedBand = The ice here is softer and smoother than on other regions of the planet.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains = The sample contains an even amount of rock and ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLanded = The sample is not as icy as you expected, in fact you're able to find some chunks that seem to be primarily rock. Any flakes of metallic material are completely rusted over.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedOxygenLakes = The fact that you're holding oxygen liquid in your hand is astonishing. It's also beyond freezing so you don't hold onto it for very long. You remark that you should try breathing underoxygen here, only to realize that your joke might result in some panic for mission control in a few hours when your signal reaches them.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = This area contains some fine salts and a lot of water ice. This was likely submerged, but Ervo's oxygen lakes seem to be disappearing, and relatively quickly at least on geologic timescales.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedPoles = This area is mainly frozen oxygen and water ice. There's a fair amount of fine salts as well.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedImpactBasin = The sample has a wide diversity of different ices, some rocky powder, and some crusty rust. It could be that a comet or similar object with a large oxygen component impacted this point and delivered the overabundance oxygen to Ervo. However that just raises more questions about why such an object would've existed.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedMountains = There's a fair amount of rock here. These mountains seem to suggest that Ervo is geologically active.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField1 = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField2 = While collecting a sample, you feel the ground shift. You begin to collect the sample faster.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = The ice here is layered, and the upper layers are fragile. These glaciers may be cells formed by movement in a small subsurface ocean under this region.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLanded = The sample is a mixture of ice and tholins, but the most striking feature is the color. Its alien beauty is both enthralling and for some reason a bit scary.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = There's a thin layer of powdery water ice here. Occasionally, you can see a flake slowly fall from the sky. This may have been the sight of large cryovolcanoes at some point in the past. Those subsurface oceans are almost certainly freezing over now.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLandedMajorGlaciers = The colors of the samples you take are striking. The tholins here are very diverse.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLandedMinorGlaciers = The colors of the samples you take are striking. The tholins here are very diverse.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = There's a layer of dark tholins, but brushing it away reveals a layer of water ice beneath.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_SodenSrfLandedMinorCanyons = There is layer of tholins here, but brushing it away reveals a layer of several types of ices beneath.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLanded = There's a lot of ice here, however there seems to be a high clay content.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedPoles = The ice content was expected to shoot up here, however there's actually more clay and rock here than anything.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedHighlands = There's a good amount of ice in this region, this includes methane ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedCraters = There's a fine dust in and around this crater, it wouldn't be hard to deduce the composition of the meteoroid that created it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedRubble = These irregular mounds all seem to have composition that is distinct from the area around them, they're even distinct relative to each other. Perhaps these mounds were at one point separate objects that integrated into Crokslev's whole.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedBigCrater = The dust covering this craters surface is mostly rocky material, and it's quite dark. This material doesn't match that found in the rings at all.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedCentralPeak = There's less dust and more ice here, perhaps this region of the craters has held onto the most native material.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedFissures = These deep gashes in Crokslev's surface provide insight into deeper layers of its makeup. It's reasonable to conclude based on these samples that Crokslev is undifferentiated.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedOriginCrater = There's a fine white powder here, it's mostly water ice. It's composition is identical to that of the rings. This must be where the object that created the rings impacted Crokslev.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedSatCraters = The dust in this crater is identical to the other three craters nearby, perhaps they share an impact event.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_CrokslevSrfLandedSouthernPile = These mounds are identical to one another, they must all have the same origin. Though how the object broke up before landing on Crokslev is a mystery. Perhaps the object was broken up by an outer planet, like Sarnus or Urlum? That would imply Crokslev was once much closer to these major planets, perhaps even a moon at some point in its past.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_GeitoSrfLandedLowlands = There's quite a bit of activity in this region, so you make sure to grab the sample quickly. It's mostly water-ice, but closer analysis reveals nucleic acids!
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_GeitoSrfLandedMidlands1 = The samples are mostly chunks of ice, but there are some rocky pebbles among them.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_GeitoSrfLandedMidlands2 = You're able to grab a piece of ice that began floating off the comet's surface after getting hit with a puff from your RCS pack, the surface level ice here seems loose.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_LintMikeyLandedLowlands = There's a large amount of rock and clays here, giving it a darker coloration than the rest of the comet. Ignoring some regional discrepancies, it would seem this object has a fairly consistent composition.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_LintMikeyLandedMidlands = The ice here is dirtied by rock and other materials, you take the time to pick out the rocks from the sample so it can be nice and clean. You realize your mistake in changing the composition of the sample and grab another chunk.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_LintMikeyLandedHighlands = The ices here have a large clay component, giving it a red tinge.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedMetalLowlands = The surface here is covered with large chunks of metal and metallic dust, you make sure to take a good variety of samples. Most of the metal is nickel and iron, but there is some rocky dust scattered around.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedRockyLowlands = The samples are mostly chunks of rock, with very trace amounts of shiny metals scattered around. This material may be what remains of the smaller asteroids that made the two major craters nearby.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedRockyHighlands = The rock layer doesn't go very deep before Zore's signature metallic composition is found again. This surface material might not even originally be from Zore, but rather from subsequent impacts by lighter, rockier asteroids.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedCraters = There's a fine layer of dust, it seems that smaller meteoroids here were nearly completely disintegrated, leaving only a thin layer of fine powder in a small crater, while the rest of the material was likely completely lost to the void of space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = These massive bowls expose a region of almost pure iron, among some flaky dust. It's quite difficult to remove a sample even with the help of tools.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = This chaotic region seems to have an even mixture of rocky and metallic material.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedLowlands = There is an icy layer beneath the rocks and dust, it's quite deep, but it does prove directly that Vant is indeed, mainly ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedHighlands = These polar regions seem to have a thinner rock layer than the rest of Vant, in fact, some areas have ice on the surface!
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedCanyons = These canyons are mostly silicates, but also have a large ice component as well.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedCraters = The dust in these craters can perhaps be used to deduce the type of class of asteroid that created them.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedCrags = The samples here are jagged piles of rubble, perhaps this is the final resting place of low-velocity "rubble-pile" asteroid.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedMudcano = This ancient cryovolcano is coated in a rocky-icy mush, which could be ancient ejecta. This is the closet a cryovolcano to the Sun ever been found.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_VantSrfLandedEquator = This region is mainly rock. The surface is quite smooth, with very little debris.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_EdasSrfLandedSurface = There's a distinct lack of loose material, so you have to chip a piece off of Edas. The sample is entirely silicates.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_EdasSrfLandedCraters = Breaking a piece off in this region shows that it's nearly identical to the rest of Edas in composition, most foreign material was likely blown into space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_surfaceSample_EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = There's a trace amount of carbonaceous material here as an extremely thin layer on the crater's bowl. You scrape off a bit of the powder, this could be material from the asteroid that made this crater.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KiKiInSpaceLow = As you orbit, Ki'Ki's surface slowly approaches and then recedes as you pass over the lobes. You make sure to triple check your telemetry, you wouldn't want to crash.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KiKiInSpaceHigh = Ki'Ki's odd shape makes it look as though it's two objects close together from some angles, and a bone-shape from other angles. You make note of the idea that this may be a contact-binary.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KiKiSrfLandedContactPoint = The two lobes of Ki'Ki take up large portions of the sky on either side of your craft, the thought of Ki'Ki's lobes suddenly collapsing in on you crosses your mind. You speed up your surface operations.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KiKiSrfLanded = Ki'Ki's surface is quite chaotic, you had trouble finding flat ground to land on.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KalInSpaceHigh = Kal's diamond shape and proximity to Havous' rings makes it look like a very appealing location. You make sure to take a picture at your earliest convenience.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KalInSpaceLow = You notice several large boulders, it seems finding level ground for a landing may be difficult. 
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KalSrfLandedLowlands = You feel as though you could've found a better place to touch down, it's so rugged here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KalSrfLandedMountains = The ship's engine evaporated some of the ice below the ship, but otherwise this is a nice vantage point.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_KalSrfLandedPeaks = You noticed while landing that the ground here gave a little bit. This region must not be very solid.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousInSpaceHigh1 = Havous is seems quite beautiful, you cross your fingers for a closer look.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousInSpaceHigh2 = The bright colors and arching rings, along with Havous' famous oblate shape, create a beautiful, if not unnerving sight. All signs point towards an ancient disaster.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousInSpaceLow1 = The rings are very pretty up close, but you're nervous whenever you hear a small ice particle hit the side of your craft.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousInSpaceLow2 = You hear a thunk and check for any holes in the ship. There's no hole, but you're startled none the less.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousSrfLanded = Looking out the window makes you feel a little sickly, the sky is visibly moving.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = The view out the window shows a chaotic landscape, you're very eager to get out and stretch your legs.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousSrfLandedScar = The targeted landing to get to this ancient impact zone was difficult to plan due to Havous' rotation. You feel happy that you managed to get here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_HavousSrfLandedPointZero = The targeted landing to get to the exact sight of an ancient impact was very difficult to plan due to Havous' rotation. You feel very accomplished that you managed to land here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_FlakeInSpaceHigh = Flake looks very puffy, even up close. 
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_FlakeInSpaceLow = Flake's surface is lumpy yet smoothed, the occasional cracks look like appealing landing challenges.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_FlakeSrfLanded = You might as well not even be near an object with gravity, let alone on one. Everything is still very much floating.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_FlakeSrfLandedCracks = This canyon is quite a pretty location, but you decide this view out the window alone might not have been worth the long trip out here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisInSpaceHigh1 = Mracksis is just as vibrant as they promised that it would be.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisInSpaceHigh2 = Mracksis' disk grows as you approach the planet, revealing features that remind you of the Mun.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisInSpaceLow1 = Mracksis' surface seems more diverse than you expected, those dark circular regions may be the sight of ancient impacts.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisInSpaceLow2 = You hear a soft thud on the side of your ship, there seem to be some small micrometeorites around Mracksis.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisSrfLanded = The reused Mun landing training simulation that you went through before launch makes sense now. Aside from the vastly different terrain of course.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisSrfLandedGlaciers = This area is a lot brighter than the rest of Mracksis, you make to block your eyes before looking out the window.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_MracksisSrfLandedMaria = You think about how you're not technically the first thing to land in this region, you're only the first to do it gently. You make a nervous glance out the window, hopefully nothing else "lands" here during your stay on the surface.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LonInSpaceHigh = Lon's odd shape has earned a fair few stares even before getting close to it. It almost feels like it's a cruel joke that after such a long travel you've been met with such a ridiculous object.	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LonInSpaceLow = The oblong shape of Lon makes you nervous as you ensure that you're not going to run into it. The shape doesn't seem so strange up close.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LonSrfLanded1 = You see Soden through the window and smile. This is quite a nice vantage point.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LonSrfLanded2 = Landing was probably the easiest part of this mission.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LonSrfLanded3 = You see the sun through the window, and suddenly you wish you were back home.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenInSpaceHigh1 = Mission control assures you that you are indeed approaching Soden, and that you're actually in its SOI. You cannot see it though, no matter how hard you squint.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenInSpaceHigh2 = You can just about make out Soden if you squint hard enough, but you're nearly pressing your eye against the glass to do so.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenInSpaceHigh3 = What you can see of Soden is quite interesting. You can't wait for a closer look after several years of nothing.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenInSpaceLow1 = Soden's surface has a shocking amount of diversity, with its island like glaciers, vibrant colors, and deep trenches.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenInSpaceLow2 = You wonder how deep the canyons go, and what secrets they might hold.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLanded = Landing this craft made you feel like you summited the highest mountain on Kerbin a thousand times over. This is the furthest dwarf planet known, and now your craft is standing on it. You are filled with pride, and maybe a bit of fear, knowing how far you've come.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLandedMajorCanyons = Watching the sides of the canyon creep up on either side of you was an intense adrenaline rush.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLandedMinorCanyons = Watching the sides of the canyon creep up on either side of you was quite the adrenaline rush.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLandedMajorGlaciers = You sit back in your seat and sigh. This has been quite the long wait, and now you're here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLandedMinorGlaciers = You've summited the Kerbolar System, and you're definitely going to brag about it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = You feel a rumble coming from underground.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeInSpaceHigh = Archae's chaotic surface implies a chaotic history. Ever since scientists back home began getting good looks at the small moon, it's been suspected that it may not have formed around Ervo at all.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeInSpaceLow = The surface isn't as dark as you anticipated, which is more than relieving. You take plenty of time to look over the interesting terrain features and toss around a few explanations.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLanded = Some have speculated that Archae once fell apart and reformed, which is why its surface is so chaotic. You hope it stays together during your stay.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedCrags = You feel as though you could've found a more level area to land in.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat1 = You feel as though you've just landed on Minmus' distant, darker cousin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedBigFlat2 = This region is very flat, aside from the scattered craters.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedSmolFlat = This region is very flat, aside from the scattered craters.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedBand = This region stuck out to you instantly, what could possibly account for this? Tidal forces? Resurfacing? An ancient impact event? Perhaps your time here will uncover some answers.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains1 = You hope these mountains have incredible views.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ArchaeSrfLandedGrandMountains2 = The presence of mountains like this has implications on Archae's geologic past. Perhaps it was once active?
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh1 = You're reminded that Ervo is the reason behind the demotion of Plock, and you feel an slight irrational resentment because of that. Then you remember that Ervo is the reason behind Dres' promotion to a dwarf planet. You can't tell if that makes you more angry or not.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh2 = Many scientists considered manned missions to Ervo unpractical. Time to prove them wrong... hopefully.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh3 = You keep glancing out the window for another glimpse at Ervo, exploring a new world is always exciting.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh4 = From afar, it is quite easy to track the periodic motion of Archae as it orbits Ervo. The more precise that charts of Archae's orbit become, the better one can estimate the mass of Ervo.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceLow1 = Occasionally, you can spot a small lone cloud. These clouds typically appear around the equator, and they don't last long before they precipitate.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceLow2 = Ervo's surface is beautifully diverse. Observations have proven that Ervo is in fact geologically active.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoInSpaceLow3 = The shadow of Archae among the stars as it orbits Ervo is a little intimidating.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoFlyingHigh = The fact that Ervo has an atmosphere is strange to you, but its been known to exist for a long time now.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoFlyingLow = There's a strong oxygen component in the thin air. You're tempted to try and breath it in, but remember that mission control told you specifically not to do so.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLanded1 = You made it. Who knows what you'll discover on this new horizon.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLanded2 = The atmosphere had more of an effect than you expected during the landing, and creates a lovely haze along the horizon.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfSplashed = As the craft floats, any metal that can rust, does. You hope that doesn't affect the craft's functionality.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedPoles = The ground made a small crunching sound when you touched down. 
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedMountains = Now this is a view. You make sure to check the environment before heading out to stretch your legs.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField1 = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField2 = You feel what you suspect to be a small tremor. Well, there's your confirmation that at least something is moving beneath the surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = You've been told these glaciers are more likely cells created by local subsurface lakes. There could be a very important discovery waiting here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedImpactBasin = This is definitely an impact basin, not dramatic enough to be responsible for Archae's formation. However, some suspect a comet hit Ervo in this very location.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = You're excited for the beach, but then you remember it's not water. Never the less, the view should be well worth it.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_CrokslevInSpaceHigh = You can make out the shape of the centaur through your window. It's rounder than you expected, which is a welcome surprise. The rings are thin and delicate.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_CrokslevInSpaceLow = You can't help but feel that your pictures might stir up the Kerbal Astronomical Society a bit. Crokslev's rounded shape suggests it's in equilibrium. That would make it fall into the category of very small dwarf planet instead of fairly large asteroid.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_CrokslevInSpaceLowBigCrater = This crater was named after the astronomer who discovered Crokslev, his name forms the latter half of the object's official name.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_CrokslevInSpaceLowCentralPeak = This central peak was named after the astronomer who discovered Crokslev's rings, his name now forms the former half of the object's official name.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_CrokslevSrfLanded = You can't help but feel that your stay at Crokslev won't be nearly as bad as it sounded during briefing. Your daydreams are interrupted by a random buzzer that you can't pinpoint. 
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_GietoInSpaceHigh = You feel pride as you approach the most famous comet known to Kerbalkind, but you're not sure you want to get too close.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_GietoInSpaceLow = You hear the patter of particles falling off Geito hitting the sides of the space craft.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_GietoSrfLanded = Your not sure if you can truly "land" on an object with such weak gravity.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LintMikeyInSpaceHigh = You had never heard of 68P/Lint-Mikey before you were briefed on this mission, but once you get a good look at its shape, you have a feeling its going to become a lot more well known.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LintMikeyInSpaceLow = This object could be a contact-binary, but how two comets came together when they have such weak gravity is anyone's guess.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_LintMikeySrfLanded = You would think "less gravity" means "easier landing." That's true, for the most part, but you're nervous you're going to fall off the comet entirely.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ZoreInSpaceHigh = Zore's distant image is visible in the window, it's quite a strange looking world, with some very large craters visible already.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ZoreInSpaceLow = Zore's gravity seems a bit high for an object its size. When noting this to mission control, they remind you that Zore is metallic, not rocky, thus has a higher density and gravity than usual objects in its size-range. They also remind you that's the entire reason you were sent here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ZoreSrfLanded = Landing on Zore was very easy to pull off, but it was difficult to find level ground to land on, not that that matters in such low gravity of course.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = It was a little scary to watch the crater's bowl rise in the craft's windows, but ultimately harmless.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = The surface here is quite chaotic, finding a landing sight was difficult, but that's not much different than the rest of Zore.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantInSpaceHigh = Even from here, Vant looks far less irregular than most asteroids, no-doubt due to its mass.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantInSpaceLow = Though the colors aren't very exciting, Vant has a multitude of diverse regions. and many large craters.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedHighlands = These highlands were denoted as such after a team of researchers denoted and official shape for Vant, which placed these regions are particularly far above that base shape, despite the fact that they are closer to the center of mass.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedLowlands = Vant's surface is rough, but it could be far worse based on what you hear about most asteroids.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedMudcano = You know that this cryovolcano is inactive, and has been for a very long time, but the idea of it suddenly erupting is rather frightening.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedValleys = These valleys are amazing! Though, this raises questions on where they might've come from, obviously Vant couldn't have had any bodies of liquid in the past, but perhaps Vant was geologically active in relatively recent history?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedCraters = Vant is fairly good at clearing up some of the larger objects in its region, with the obvious exceptions of Dres and Zore of course. The real question is, did these objects hit Vant, or did Vant hit them? That doesn't really matter, but it's fun to think about.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedCrags = Lots of mounts are tightly packed together here, who knows where they came from.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_VantSrfLandedEquator = The subtle rills of this equatorial depression made it quite an appealing region to visit.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_EdasInSpaceHigh = You're glad you found Edas before it was destroyed or perturbed by Duna. Not that there was any chance of that of course, just good to be ready for anything.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_EdasInSpaceLow = While Edas is a notable asteroid compared to the usual ones found around Kerbin, it seems to share the same general features, irregular shape, smooth surface, scattered craters, and so on.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_EdasSrfLandedSurface = The surface is very smooth on Edas, you wonder if it's gravity is just too weak to hold onto boulders.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_EdasSrfLandedCraters = These craters are very smooth, and impact ejecta, dust, and debris was blown back into interplanetary space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_CrewReport_EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = This is the largest crater on Edas, and the asteroid that made it probably wouldn't even make it through Kerbin's atmosphere.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KiKiInSpaceHigh = You look around, and find yourself staring at Havous, and then at Ki'Ki. What luck that two strange objects happen to exist so close together.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KiKiInSpaceLow = Ki'Ki's shape is fascinating. You wonder how many objects like Ki'Ki exist outside the orbit of distant dwarf planets.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KiKiSrfLanded = You stand on the rugged surface, and glance up at Havous. This is a strange frontier. How many people even knew that Havous and its moons existed before your mission here?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KiKiSrfLandedContactPoint = This region is fun, the massive lobes on either side of you dominate the sky. You know they're stable in place, but you're still uneasy.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KalInSpaceHigh = This is a lovely view, but you don't want to wander too far from your ship.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KalInSpaceLow = Kal almost seems as though it was made out of random chunks it picked up from the rings of Havous.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KalSrfLanded = Kal's lumpy surface stretches... not very far. It's quite small, and you can still tell even while standing on it. Or is that just because you saw it from space and can't get its size out of your head?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KalSrfLandedMountains = Havous dominates the sky, along with its arching rings. You look out at the rugged land scape. Beautiful yet desolate.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_KalSrfLandedPeaks = The ground's color here matches Havous' rings. Perhaps they're connected.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousInSpaceHigh = You try not to wander too far from your ship, its been your home for awhile now. The Havous System is strangely beautiful to watch however.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousInSpaceLow = You're sure to avoid getting hit with particles from the rings, but you do make sure to grab some if it's safe.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousSrfLanded1 = The view of Havous' rings and moons overhead is quite astonishing.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousSrfLanded2 = You wonder if you could make something out of the loose ice here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousSrfLandedScar = Knowing that you're standing on the location where another dwarf planet impacted Havous is quite alarming for some reason.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousSrfLandedPointZero = You're standing at the exact location where Havous and another dwarf planet touched. The rings, moons, and Havous' rapid spin are all likely the result of that impact.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_HavousSrfLandedMontesTimor = The view is simply incredible.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_FlakeInSpaceHigh = You're not sure you want to be out of your ship, micrometeorites seem to be common around Flake's orbit.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_FlakeInSpaceLow = You watch as the surface of Flake moves below you, you could probably get down to the surface and back again without a ship.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_FlakeSrfLanded = Flake is very fluffy, you're tempted to hug it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_FlakeSrfLandedCracks = This is a lovely view, you can't wait to show your friends and family the photos. Of course, they'll probably already have seen it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_FlakeSrfLandedPoles = You're standing on top of a very small world.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_MracksisInSpaceHigh = You put up a thumb and watch as Mracksis disappears behind it. You do the same to Kerbol. You feel a bit sad, so you move your thumb out of the way.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_MracksisInSpaceLow = Mracksis is beautiful. You almost forget that you might end up getting hit by a micrometeorite.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_MracksisSrfLanded = You begin to say something inspirational, but find yourself suddenly cut off by a feeling of isolation. Kerbol is smaller than Flake in the sky.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_MracksisSrfLandedMaria = These craters remind you of those on the Mun. You find that you actually miss the Mun quite a bit.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_MracksisSrfLanded = You sit down and look up, realizing that Mracksis isn't even the last frontier of the Kerbolar System is both exciting and terrifying. You look at the bright specks of the giant planets near Kerbol.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LonInSpace = Serenity.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LonSrfLanded = Soden's orb in the sky is beautifully inspiring. It reminds you of what it was like to imagine landing the Mun as a child. You've gone a lot further than the Mun now.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LonSrfLanded = As you sit and consider the isolation of Soden and its lone moon, you find it strange that Soden only has the one. It has a massive SOI, yet only one moon. You trace the sky with your eyes, wondering if anything else is out there.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenInSpaceHigh1 = You hum a tune that no one hears.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenInSpaceHigh2 = Kerbol looks like any other star, you may be approaching the limits of this solar system, but who knows. Maybe one day, Kerbal-kind will venture further.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenInSpaceHigh3 = During your EVA operations you stop to glance at Soden and Lon. What secrets could they hold?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenInSpaceLow = Splendid. Soden's beauty is either genuine or a result of the journey out here leaving you begging to see anything.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenSrfLanded1 = You kick a small stone and watch it disappear into the distance. You feel a bad.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenSrfLanded2 = You put your arms on your hips in pride as you find a good place to place a flag. You've made it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_SodenSrfLandedCanyonsAll = You look around and wonder where these canyons came from. Perhaps Soden was more active at some point in its past.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ArchaeInSpaceLowBand = Archae's strange, flat band seems to call out to you. Where did it come from? It's a weird ring-like feature around the moon... ring... hmm. You're sure to write that down.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ArchaeInSpaceHigh = What a view! You try to get Archae and Ervo in the same shot just to appreciate how different they are from one another.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ArchaeInSpaceLow1 = You note the amount of craters on Archae rivals every other object beyond Neidon. This further adds to the mystery of Archae's origin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ArchaeInSpaceLow2 = You wonder if Archae really is from this part of the solar system.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ArchaeSrfLanded = You take a moment of ease. Landing is stressful, especially after such a long trip. You take a moment to enjoy the dark landscape of Ervo's lone moon.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh1 = You take a moment to consider every previous mission you can remember. From the Mun, to Neidon, to Plock, to beyond, the space program just keeps going further. You look at the stars, and wonder how far away they truly are.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoInSpaceHigh2 = You stare at Ervo and Archae in the distance. They're almost tranquil.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoInSpaceLow = Floating among these distant objects is somewhat comforting, as if you're paying a visit to an old friend.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoFlying = You really want to get back into the craft. Risking your life after such a long voyage makes you anxious.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLanded1 = Now this is a nice vantage point. You look at Kerbol and realize you can see everyone's house from here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLanded2 = What wonders await us here?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLanded3 = You wonder if people will ever live in bases, or even colonies, on worlds beyond Plock. You chuckle, there's no way someone would be that crazy. Right?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfSplashed = This is freezing cold and by extension not very fun. You no longer want to swim in Ervo's lakes.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField1 = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneath its surface, quite controversially. You make several headlines because of this.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField2 = You feel the ground shake, and you no longer want to be here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField3 = How far would you have to drill to reach the liquid beneath these cells?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneath its surface, quite controversially. You make several headlines because of this.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = You let your mind wonder and begin to think aloud about the idea that Ervo might host life beneath its surface, quite controversially. You make several headlines because of this.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedMountains = You get an eye full of the view. You're inspired by the landscape, and optimistic that your mission will inspire more people to join in your footsteps.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ErvoSrfLandedCoastalBasins = You can't wait to go for a swim, but then again, it's not going to be very pleasant.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevInSpaceHigh = As you check the status of your craft, you can't help but glance at Crokslev. It's like an island in a vast black sea. Mission control tells you to stop daydreaming.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevInSpaceLow = The rings are larger than what can be seen with the naked eye, several more, very thin rings glimmer in the sun's light.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLanded = You wish you had a telescope, Sarnus and Urlum must be beautiful from here. You feel a little dizzy at the idea of seeing Kerbin from out here, only to identify a blue dot near the sun.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLandedCentralPeak = You declare yourself king of a very small world.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLandedRubble = This is a nice field of lumps.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLandedSouthernPile = This is a very nice field of lumps.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLandedFissures = These cracks put Dres' canyon to shame.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_CrokslevSrfLandedPoles = You're a little sad that the rings aren't easily visible here, but with gravity so low, it wouldn't be hard to fly up for a peak.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_GietoInSpaceHigh = When this comet gets to peribol, it's going to be quite a show for everyone on Kerbin...         ...hopefully.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_GietoInSpaceLow = This feels dangerous, you have to dodge any particularly large pieces of comet ejecta.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_GietoSrfLanded = Planting a flag on a comet is a great thing to brag about, though you don't know how long a flag would last here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LintMikeyInSpaceHigh = You wonder how long this comet will last, and if it will ever put on a particularly good show for your friends on Kerbin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LintMikeyInSpaceLow = You're a little nervous about the hitting the comet as it rotates beneath you, but when you realize how slow you're going your fears are eased, mostly.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_LintMikeySrfLanded = You don't feel like you've landed on Lint-Mikey, more that you've approached a large rock and put your feet lightly against it.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreInSpaceHigh = The situation is nominal, and Zore looks like a very interesting place to visit, even from here. It's strange to think about Dres and Vant being so relatively close yet so very different.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreInSpaceLow = Zore has a quite chaotic surface, occasionally interrupted by large craters or gashes. Watching it slowly move as you orbit it is quite entertaining, but you need to focus on the mission.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedRockyLowlands = The dust is getting everywhere, easily kicked up by your bounds across the surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedMetalLowlands = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks, tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedRockyHighlands = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks, tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedCraters = The dust is getting everywhere, easily kicked up by your bounds across the surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedMajorCraters = This area is actually very smooth and solid compared to the rest of Zore's surface, not many large rocks or debris to be seen.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_ZoreSrfLandedCraggleField = You have to watch your steps, the surface is covered in chaotic rocks, some of which are quite jagged, tripping isn't an issue, but puncturing your spacesuit is.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantInSpaceHigh = You were a little scared to step out of your spacecraft, knowing that this is the asteroid belt. However, looking around you see only one, very large asteroid, which of course is Vant. You feel as though those old space operas betrayed you.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantInSpaceLow = Vant's valleys look like exciting places to send rovers, though you're not sure wheeled rovers would be practical on such a small object.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedHighlands = You squint as hard as you can, and can't make out any other asteroids nearby. Mission control assures you this is entirely normal, asteroids are quite spread out after all. That doesn't stop you from feeling a little disappointed however.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedLowlands = The gravity is very low here, this may be the largest asteroid in size, but it's certainly not the most massive.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedCraters = These craters are a good sign that Vant, indeed, is in the asteroid belt, and has suffered many impacts because of it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedValleys = These valleys might be fun to set up a race through, though that also sounds dangerous.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedCrags = You have to watch your step to avoid any particularly jagged rocks, puncturing your spacesuit would not be fun.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_VantSrfLandedEquator = This is quite a smooth region, though it's hilly, there's not many rocks or chunks around here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_EdasInSpaceHigh = You note that Edas reassembles a slipper, some people back at mission control chuckle.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_EdasInSpaceLow = Edas feels more like an equal than any other object you've visited. You can't help but imagine you are companions as you fly through interplanetary space together.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_EdasSrfLandedSurface = To say you are standing on Edas seems wrong, rather you are clinging onto it as you would a spacecraft.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_EdasSrfLandedCraters = You wonder how big a crater could get on an asteroid like this without the impact shattering it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_evaReport_EdasSrfLandedPolarCrater = If this impact had been any larger you wonder if Edas would've been shattered.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_KiKiInSpaceHigh = The goo seems chilly.

		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_KalInSpaceHigh = The goo shutters and begins to fizz.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_KalInSpaceLow = The goo has formed a set of connected pustules. One of them bursts. It's revolting.

		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_MracksisInSpace = The goo is extremely anxious.

		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_MracksisSrfLanded = The goo solidifies and turns red. It's shuddering.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LonInSpace = The goo is frustrated with you.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LonInSpaceLow = The goo doesn't like Lon, yet it seems to eagerly look out of its container.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LonSrfLanded = The goo has its eyes on the stars.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SodenInSpaceHigh = The goo waits patiently.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SodenInSpaceLow = The goo is looking for something.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SodenSrfLanded = The goo is happy and excited.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = The goo feels close to home here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ArchaeInSpaceHigh = The goo seems hopeful.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ArchaeInSpaceLow = The goo seems to be attracted to the side of the container facing Archae.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ArchaeSrfLanded = The goo wants you to go further.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ErvoInSpaceHigh = The goo sloshes around the container before bubbling slightly.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ErvoInSpaceLow = The goo bubbles like crazy.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ErvoFlying = The goo wobbles and begins to exit the capsule. You make sure to close it a little so it doesn't completely escape.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ErvoSrfLanded = The goo is churning.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ErvoSrfSplashed = The goo dissolves.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_CrokslevInSpaceHigh = The goo glimmers, but gets shy and stops when it notices you looking.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_CrokslevInSpaceLow = The goo seems to be quite nervous.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_CrokslevSrfLanded = The goo glimmers, but a little confidently. When you look it only dims slightly.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_GeitoInSpaceHigh = The goo forms a series of complex shapes that you can't quite describe. It's quite horrifying, but you feel that it's trying to tell you something. Mission control tells you to snap out of it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_GeitoInSpaceLow = It's a map, but it's not quite right yet. You can make out the position of Kerbin and its moons however. What does this mean?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_GeitoSrfLanded = The goo floats out the container, you see it begin to shape itself, but then it's blown away geyser, never to be seen again.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LintMikeyInSpace = The goo wobbles and becomes a strange polygonal shape.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_LintMikeySrfLanded = The goo floats until it comes to rest on a chunk of ice. The chunk is then blasted into space by a geyser.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ZoreInSpaceHigh = The goo turns orange and shatters.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ZoreInSpaceLow = Pieces of goo chip away at the inside of the container.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_ZoreSrfLanded = The goo is hardened, as if inspired by Zore's hard metallic nature.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_VantInSpace = The goo seems to be planning something. Maybe you're just anxious.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_VantSrfLanded = The goo dissolves in a fizzy mess of bubbles.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_EdasInSpace = The goo feels an amazing sense of relief.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mysteryGoo_EdasSrfLanded = The goo appears to be thanking you.
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KiKiInSpace = The materials slowly float out and away, some of the biosamples explode.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KiKiSrfLanded = Some materials change color, but the rest don't do a thing.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KiKiSrfLandedContactPoint = One of the materials flies out of the bay rapidly, you feel like something went wrong, so you don't tell mission control about that one.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KalInSpaceHigh = Some of the materials glow brightly as the reflect light from Havous and its bright rings.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KalInSpaceLow = Nothing happens, so you jolt the ship a little bit. One of the biosamples seem annoyed.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KalSrfLanded = One of the crystals fall out and you lose sight of it among the diverse rocks of Kal's surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_KalSrfLandedPeaks = The materials glimmer in the bright light of Havous, you can't help but feel jealous in Havous' ability to bring out the best in others.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_HavousInSpaceHigh = The materials swirl in the zero-g environment, you lose some of the samples to the vacuum of space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_HavousInSpaceLow = There must have been some air trapped in the bay, because all of the materials got sucked out into space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_HavousSrfLanded = The materials are very dizzy, but you can see that gravity may be influenced by Havous' rotation.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_HavousSrfLandedPoles = The materials are subject to the highest gravity Havous can offer, which isn't much.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_FlakeInSpaceHigh = The materials are getting chilly.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_FlakeInSpaceLow = One of the free floating materials is hit by a micrometeorite and explodes into many fine grains.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_FlakeSrfLanded = Most of the liquids sublimate, the only liquid left is a small amount of mystery goo that was included in the bay. Figures.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_MracksisInSpaceHigh = The materials are very much still there, but aside from that seem to have only become heavily irradiated by the trip out here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_MracksisInSpaceLow = Some of the ice samples have begun to darken, others have become pinkish.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_MracksisSrfLanded = Some of the ice samples have turned red. A lot of the samples have turned red. You realize that some fine powder-like dust was kicked into the bay by the engines upon landing. 
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_MracksisSrfLandedIceFields = The materials don't seem to find Mracksis very hospitable.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_MracksisSrfLandedGlaciers = The materials are quite cold, and some of the softer samples dissolve.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_LonInSpace = The materials drift slowly out into the abyss, you can't help but pity them. They don't get to come back to Kerbin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_LonSrfLanded = The samples froze over, it's not exactly a startling discovery, but now you know for sure that Lon is, in fact, cold.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SodenInSpaceHigh = The samples haven't done a thing in a very long time, and even now after the bay doors open, nothing happens. It's a little sad.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SodenInSpaceLow = The samples drift out into space, but some of them seem to sparkle before dissolving.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_SodenSrfLanded = The samples fall slowly out onto Soden's chilly surface. The one biosamples that survives tries to bury itself, but doesn't get very far before it too dies. You wonder if throwing biosamples into the universe is a bad plan.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ArchaeInSpace = Something suddenly shoots out into space and tumbles as it does so, it seems a gas canister was burst by a corrosive acid. The materials bay is a mess.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ArchaeSrfLanded = One of the samples drifts out and lands onto Archae's surface, it sinks and is never seen again.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ErvoInSpaceHigh = One of the materials begins to glow. It causes a stir among the scientific community, before it's pointed out to be a metallic material reflecting sunlight.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ErvoInSpaceLow = The materials drift out into space and one can pick out several shapes in the resulting cloud of junk before it disperses.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ErvoFlying = The materials fall out into the air, one of them sparks and catches fire.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ErvoSrfLanded = All of the metallic samples rust instantly.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ErvoSrfSplashed = Some of the materials heat up a lot due to the reactive oxygen ceasing an opportunity.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_CrokslevInSpace = Some of the materials seem to be reflective like the rings. You wonder if this can tell you more about the make-up of the rings. It's most likely water-ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_CrokslevSrfLanded = The materials seem quite bored, unable to appreciate where they are.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_GeitoInSpace = Some of the more reactive metals rust as water from Geito's coma gets into the bay. You're going to be drying out the bay for days.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_GeitoSrfLanded = What materials don't get blown away by the comet's ejections are rusting rapidly. Most of the materials shatter when a large rock is flung into the bay.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_LintMikeyInSpace = One of the biosamples seems to be quite amazed with the comet, then you realize it was just decompressing due to space being a vacuum.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_LintMikeySrfLanded = You've scattered random materials across the surface and nearby space of a comet. You wonder if this experiment was worth bringing.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ZoreInSpace = You notice that some of the samples have become quite shiny, though the reasons why are unclear.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_ZoreSrfLanded = Some of the materials become quite brittle in a vacuum and crumble into fine dust.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_VantInSpace = The materials seem to like Vant, at least from orbit. If "liking" means remaining mostly unchanged of course.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_VantSrfLanded = The observations you make on Vant's surface, or any other low-gravity non-atmospheric body, should be very much what you'd expect to happen in the middle of space, and they are.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_EdasInSpace = The materials seem relatively unchanged, apart from the usual decompression, boiling, freezing you would expect from a vacuum.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_mobileMaterialsLab_EdasSrfLanded = Just bringing the bay here has brought Edas a great deal more material diversity than it has ever seen.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_KiKiInSpace = It's cold out here. Most substances found on Kerbin would be solid.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_KiKiSrfLanded = Ki'Ki seems to absorb a fair amount of heat, however it doesn't have any significant effects on the object. Ki'Ki radiates heat from its dark side, and this raises questions about how stable Ki'Ki's orbit is in the long term.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_KalInSpace = The low temperatures might allow for a large amount of volatiles to exist on Kal's surface.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_KalSrfLanded = Kal is very cold, like everything else in the Havous System.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_KalSrfLandedLowlands = Kal's rubble fields are darker, and thus absorb slightly more heat.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_HavousInSpace = It's not exactly pleasant out here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_HavousSrfLanded = Havous is the coldest body in the Havous System.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_HavousSrfLandedScar = There's a little bit of heat trapped below the surface here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_HavousSrfLandedPointZero = There's a fair amount of heat trapped below the surface here.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_FlakeInSpace = The low temperatures might imply that Flake is entirely volatiles, which has been suggested by some planetary scientists.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_FlakeSrfLanded = There is no internal heat at all coming from Flake.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_MracksisInSpace = The low temperatures are exactly as expected.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_MracksisSrfLanded = Mracksis is geologically dead, there's no heat coming from under ground.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_LonInSpace = This is one of the coldest locations ever seen.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_LonSrfLanded = As if it wasn't cold enough in the day, it gets worse at night.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_SodenInSpace = The temperature drops very slowly as you continue to approach Soden.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_SodenInSpaceLow = This could very well be the coldest part of the Kerbolar System.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_SodenSrfLanded = One could wonder if Soden at its furthest point from the sun gets a significant fraction of heat from other stars. When you suggest that idea people laugh at you, and you realize just how far the other stars really are.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = Soden isn't quite dead yet, there's a hotspot in this region.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ArchaeInSpace = Yep, it's pretty cold.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ArchaeSrfLanded = There's a faint heat coming from below the ground. Heat from a more recent impact event maybe.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoInSpace = Wow, it's pretty cold out here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoFlying = The cold air causes a layer of frost to build up on the thermometer. Many people doubted an atmosphere could ever exist out here, yet here it is.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLanded = It's often debated whether or not Ervo could host any form of light weather despite the low solar energy levels. Checking the temperature just casts more doubt on that idea.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfSplashed = It's just barely too hot for liquid oxygen on the surface of the lakes, it seems that Ervo is slowly losing its oxygen. Who knows how much it might've had in the past.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLandedPoles = It's just cold enough for stable oxygen ice here, this may be the only permanent oxygen on Ervo.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = There's some subsurface heating here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ErvoSrfLandedMountains = Temperature lowers with elevation, just like on Kerbin.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_CrokslevInSpace = It's cold enough for methane to be an ice out here, perhaps we'll find some.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_CrokslevSrfLanded = The object has relatively hot days and terribly cold nights.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_GietoInSpace = It's cold, but as the comet approaches Kerbol, it's going to get a whole lot hotter.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_GietoSrfLanded = As the comet warms up, things are getting more exciting, geysers erupt, the coma gets larger, and the heart rate of everyone at mission control gets way faster.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_LintMikeyInSpace = As Lint-Mikey orbits the sun, it experiences a lot of temperature shifting. It gets colder than Vall at its furthest, and almost as warm as the Mun at its closest.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_LintMikeySrfLanded = The comet shows no signs of internal heating. Its geysers only erupt on the day side however.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ZoreInSpace = You know, measuring the temperature of space seems to be impossible and what-not, but the craft itself does get warmer or colder based on where it is in the solar system, which is probably a much more helpful reading to take. For instance, here it's cold enough for ice to exist, though large ice deposits might not survive unless and object had permanantly shadowed regions, or a high gravitational pull. Thus, one can hypothesize that Zore will have little to no ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_ZoreSrfLanded = The temperature changes drastically as Zore rotates.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_VantInSpace = Vant being icy seems strange, perhaps it formed much further from Kerbol than it is now.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_VantSrfLanded = During the day, Vant's surface is too hot for ice to survive, you wonder if this means that as Vant moved inwards that it had a very large comet-like tail.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_EdasInSpace = Edas gets a fair amount of seasonal heating and cooling due to its eccentric orbit.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_temperatureScan_EdasSrfLanded = Edas' surface changes drastically in temperature due to its lack of atmosphere. The heat radiating off the surface during the night might be able to move Edas slowly, like a very low energy thruster.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_KiKiInSpace = There's no atmosphere here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_KiKiSrfLanded = Nothing to see here, just the vacuum of space.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_KalInSpace = There's nothing here, maybe try getting closer?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_KalInSpaceLow = There's no atmosphere here... try getting a bit closer.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_KalSrfLanded = There's no atmosphere here after all. Glad that mystery is solved.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_HavousInSpace = There's nothing out here to read.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_HavousSrfLanded = Havous might not be able to hold onto an atmosphere.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_FlakeInSpace = Well, if you count the occasional bit of dust or micrometeorite, then there's something here. The instrument however, reads zero flat.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_FlakeSrfLanded = Flake and objects like it could never hold an atmosphere according to all models. This observation confirms those models.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_MracksisInSpace = There's not much to see here, and there's no atmosphere either.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_MracksisSrfLanded = There's a very, very thin exosphere of xenon.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_LonInSpace = Well, no atmosphere to be found.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_LonSrfLanded = You find the lack of atmosphere disturbing.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_SodenInSpace = Atmospheres don't usually stretch this far into space. The one you're trying to measure doesn't even exist.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_SodenSrfLanded = Nothing to see here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = There's a very occasional tick on the barometer, there might be a very thin, local exosphere here.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ArchaeInSpace = No atmosphere to be found.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ArchaeSrfLanded = There's a lack of atmosphere, which to some scientists is quite shocking, due to Ervo's atmosphere being very much real.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ErvoInSpace = You're not going to read any atmosphere yet.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ErvoFlyingHigh = There's an atmosphere here, it's very thin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ErvoFlyingLow = The atmosphere is the thickest observed beyond Plock, but that's not saying much.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_Crokslev = There's a good search effort put towards finding any exosphere at all, but none is ever found.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_Geito = The coma's density can be measured with this barometer, but it has to be used very carefully to do so.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_LintMikey = The coma's density can be measured with this barometer, but it has to be used extremely carefully to do so.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ZoreInSpace = There's nothing out here, it's unlikely Zore would have any atmosphere at all.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_ZoreSrfLanded = Zore has no atmosphere at all.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_VantInSpace = It would be quite a surprise if even the biggest asteroid had any reasonable atmosphere, so far it looks like Vant doesn't.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_VantSrfLanded = Nothing to see here, you're disappointed but not surprised.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_barometerScan_Edas = There's nothing at all here.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KiKiInSpace = This tiny moon doesn't have very strong gravity.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KiKiSrfLandedMajorLobe = This lobe has a slightly higher mass than its twin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KiKiSrfLandedMinorLobe = This lobe has a slightly lower mass than its twin.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KiKiSrfLandedContactPoint = There's a slight pull from either side of the craft coming from the lobes.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KalInSpace = Even this close to Kal, there's still a strong pull from Havous, well, a relatively strong pull.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_KalSrfLanded = There is some doubt about the stability of Kal, Havous might be pulling it apart.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_HavousInSpace = Havous is pretty small, so the pull isn't incredible. Never the less, it's still enough for Havous to host moons and a ring system.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_HavousSrfLanded = The gravity on Havous is quite strange, due to its rotation and shape, the closer you go to the poles, the stronger gravity gets.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_HavousSrfLandedPoles = This is the strongest surface gravity Havous has to offer, and it's not much.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_FlakeInSpace = It's shocking this moon can even hold itself together.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_FlakeSrfLanded = Mracksis is expected to rip Flake apart in the near future, well, near in astronomical terms.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_MracksisInSpace = Mracksis' gravity is slightly weaker than the Mun's.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_MracksisSrfLanded = The surface gravity is ever so slightly higher than expected, Mracksis might have a very small rocky core.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_LonInSpace = Observe, the gravitational strength of a potato.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_LonInSpace = It's not much, but it's enough for Lon.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_LonSrfLanded = Lon's orbit is slightly off. It's so slight that it could never have been noticed from Kerbin, it might not have even been noticeable from Soden.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_SodenInSpace = Soden is so far from Kerbol, that even its minimal gravity has a huge SOI. It's a wonder that Soden has only capture one moon. Or perhaps... it only has one KNOWN moon?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_SodenInSpaceLow = There's a slight tug that doesn't fit with Soden or Lon, it's miniscule but it shouldn't be there.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_SodenSrfLanded = This was an easy landing, the gravity here is really low.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ArchaeInSpace = This is the second largest moon known around a dwarf planet, it's gravity is similar to that of Minmus.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ArchaeSrfLanded = The readings bug out for a few seconds before correcting themselves.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ErvoInSpace = Behold, the gravity of the largest dwarf planet. Honestly, it's not really that much is it?
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ErvoFlying = Ervo has just enough gravity to hold its thin atmosphere in place, but it seems to be losing it slowly to space.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ErvoSrfLanded = It's impressive how little worlds with little gravity can hold a fair amount in place.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ErvoSrfSplashed = Good thing these sensors detect particles instead of force, the buoyancy counter acts the force of gravity slightly.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_CrokslevInSpace = There's not much to be found, yet this object holds rings.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_CrokslevSrfLanded = How could an impact ever be so gentle that it allowed material to be captured by such a small object?
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_GeitoInSpace = You're not quite familiar with measuring using micro-gees, but you have to here.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_GeitoSrfLanded = This gravity is probably not going to do a very good job of holding you down.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_LintMikeyInSpace = You are able to measure the micro-gee environment here up to four decimal places, this should help find a stable orbit to park in.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_LintMikeySrfLanded = With such low gravity, you should really consider attaching to Lint-Mikey instead of hoping for the best.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ZoreInSpace = With new, more accurate observations of Zore's shape and size, just by looking at the gravity data one can deduce and confirm Zore's long suspected metallic composition.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_ZoreSrfLanded = Zore's surface gravity is quite high for objects of its size, but it's exactly what was expected for a metal world.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_VantInSpace = By looking at the low gravity of Vant and comparing it with its size, it's quite easy to figure out that Vant is mostly ice.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_VantSrfLanded = Vant's surface gravity is quite low for an object of its size, but it's exactly what you'd expect for an ice world.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_EdasInSpace = Not much to be seen in terms of gravity, you wonder how much your ship is pulling Edas as opposed to Edas pulling your craft.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_gravityScan_EdasSrfLanded = The microgravity is the opposite of intense. Some form of coupling to Edas is recommended.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_KiKiSrfLanded = There's no activity here, which is good, you wouldn't want the lobes to collapse while you're on the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_KalSrfLanded = There's a few very small tremors very few minutes, it seems Havous' weak gravity is still enough to tug at Kal.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_HavousSrfLanded = Havous seems to be geologically dead.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_HavousSrfLandedGlaciers = The glaciers are slowly moving across the surface.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_FlakeSrfLanded = There's not much activity here at all. It's expected that that might change one day, when Flake becomes a ring system around Mracksis.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_MracksisSrfLanded = Mracksis is a dead world.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_MracksisSrfLandedGlaciers = The glaciers are barely moving.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_LonSrfLanded = Nothing to see here, although there's evidence that there might have been some tidal activity here a long time ago.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_SodenSrfLanded = Well, it's not much, but there does seem to be some weak geologic activity here on Soden. Soden is probably not going to be geologically active much longer, in fact it's debatable if Soden even counts as it is today.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_SodenSrfLandedTigerStripes = This seems to be the origin of the small tremors, the subsurface lakes must be freezing over.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ArchaeSrfLanded = Archae is far enough away to avoid any tidal stress from Ervo, so how did Archae's surface get the way it is now?
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ErvoSrfLanded = There are weak tremors here on Ervo, this is a geologically active world for sure.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ErvoSrfLandedMountains = This is a convergent boundary, Ervo might have a liquid interior globally.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ErvoSrfLandedRoughGlacierField = There's some strong activity here, this may be a thin area in the crust above the subsurface ocean.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ErvoSrfLandedMinorGlacierField = There's a good amount of activity under this area.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ErvoSrfLandedSmoothGlacierField = There's a good amount of activity under this area.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_CrokslevSrfLanded = Crokslev seems to be completely dead.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_GeitoSrfLanded = You can detect rather large eruptions as the comet approaches the Sun.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_LintMikeySrfLanded = You can detect faint blips as geysers erupt from the comet.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ZoreSrfLanded = Zore seems to be dead geologically.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_ZoreSrfLandedCraggleFields = Zore may be dead, but this region may prove that Zore was at one point active, though the rest of the evidence has been lost to time.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_VantSrfLanded = Vant's seismic activity is a boring flatline, which is a real shame, because the surface suggests that Vant was at one point very active.
	
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_seismicScan_EdasSrfLanded = Edas is very dead, it's unlikely it ever had any activity at all.
		
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_ErvoFlyingHigh = There seems to be a lot more oxygen in Ervo's upper atmosphere, perhaps since it has less to react with up here? No matter the reasons why Ervo's atmosphere seems to have higher oxygen concentrations up here, it does make everyone a little nervous about how the spacecraft might react, or rather, how this oxygen might react with it.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_ErvoFlyingLow = Oxygen levels are decreasing now, this is likely because the surface absorbs most of the oxygen into it as it oxydizes. However, it never seems to go away at any altitude.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_ErvoSrfLanded = The oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere of Ervo almost reflects that of Kerbin's atmosphere oh-so-far away from here. However, this concentration of oxygen is most certainly toxic. A quick breath might not hurt, or... perhaps might hurt a lot. It might just depends on the Kerbal taking that bitter Ervo-air in.
		#LOC_MPE_SciDef_atmosphereAnalysis_ErvoSrfSplashed = There's a sort of... oxygen-steam coming off of these lakes. It's a rather exotic feature, though does seem to imply that the oxygen in this lakes travelled here from further off the equator through rivers. These lakes might be better described as "seas."

		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Edas_InSpace = The solar wind does little more than slip past Edas.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Vant_InSpace = Kerbol's solar wind doesn't interact much with stony little Vant.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Zore_InSpace = An extremely weak magnetic field is distorting the solar wind very slightly!
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_LintMikey_InSpace = As 68P passes perihelion, the surface begins to emit ionized particles as a tail forms, and it begins to gradually sublimate.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Crokslev_InSpace = Crokslev seems to only create a small shadow in the solar wind as it orbits far above Kerbol.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Geito_InSpace = When Geito reaches perihelion, a striking comet tail forms and the antennae pick up charged particles everywhere.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Havous_InSpaceHigh = Havous appears to lack any appreciable magnetic field; however faint readings from the surface suggest interactions with the solar wind are taking place.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Havous_InSpaceLow = Despite its distance from Kerbol, readings indicate the solar wind is still gradually blasting particles off of Havous' surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Kal_InSpace = Kal's surface appears to react slowly with the solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_KiKi_InSpace = At this distance, little Ki'Ki doesn't interact notably with the solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Mracksis_InSpace = Surface ices are reacting slowly with the solar wind, producing reddish compounds called tholins that give Mracksis its distinctive color.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Flake_InSpace = Flake does not seem to be reacting much with the solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Ervo_InSpace = Ervo's thin nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is not protected by a magnetic field, but at this distance the solar wind does little to damage it; only producing a steady trickle of charged particles.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Archae_InSpace = The solar wind slips around Archae, parted like a pebble in a stream.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Soden_InSpace = Interactions with the traces of solar wind and interstellar medium seem to have produced tholin compounds in Soden's surface, explaining its pinkish 'snow' and dark maroon highlands.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_rpwsScan_Lon_InSpace = Lon does not appear to have anything going on that the RPWS instrument can detect.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Edas_InSpaceHigh = Little Edas isn't so little! If this hit Kerbin... well, let's just say the crater lake that killed the giant bugs would look tiny by comparison. Let's keep an eye on this one.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Edas_InSpaceLow = Edas' surface is lumpy, and marked with countless craters of all sizes.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Vant_InSpaceHigh = Vant reminds you of nothing so much as a giant, gray potato.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Vant_InSpaceLow = Like other stony asteroids, Vant's surface is pockmarked with craters. The only real difference is size.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Zore_InSpaceHigh = Zore's surface seems to vary between pale brownish rocky highlands and bright, gray metallic lowlands.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Zore_InSpaceLow = Zore's surface almost seems reflective under certain lighting conditions. The low, gray regions reflect the most.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_LintMikey_InSpaceHigh = 68P does kind of look like a wad of lint from this distance, so at least one of the discoverer's names is appropriate.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = The twin dumbbell shape of this comet is quite the unusual sight. Evidently, 68P is the result of a slow collision between two objects.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Crokslev_InSpaceHigh = Crokslev's unique thin ring system is something of an anomaly. You'd have said it was too small to have them, if you weren't looking directly at evidence to the contrary.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = This dwarf planet has a rather chaotic surface, warped by forces that aren't exactly clear. Whether this is evidence of cryovolcanism or something else will require more study.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Geito_InSpaceHigh = These are the closest images we've ever gotten of Geito, and it's... well, kind of a letdown to be honest. It's just a big snowball.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Geito_InSpaceLow = You're sure the public will appreciate the magnitude of this achievement, and won't mind the fact that Geito is kind of just a big space snowball.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Havous_InSpaceHigh = Havous' surface reminds you a bit of a pancake, a bit of a potato, and a bit of the Mun. None of those things have beautiful rings, though!
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Havous_InSpaceLow = At this low altitude, images can be taken of Havous' dramatically varied surface. It kind of looks like a big, oval-shaped eye when the giant scar is in the sunlight.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Kal_InSpaceHigh = Kal is dark, gray and dirty. It's probably covered mostly in water ice, possibly with some tholins or rocky compounds tinting it darker.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Kal_InSpaceLow = Lighter deposits on Kal's surface likely originate from Havous' rings.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_KiKi_InSpaceHigh = Ki'Ki's dark reddish surface is almost certainly covered in tholin compounds; which are formed from simple hydrocarbons reacting with solar wind or cosmic rays; often involving water or nitrogen.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_KiKi_InSpaceLow = We've read the Wikerbpedia article about tholins now. There's not really much else to see here; Ki'Ki is quite featureless aside from its dual-lobed shape indicating it's a contact binary.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Mracksis_InSpaceHigh = Mracksis is so red that you briefly wonder if it's a very, very lost rocky object covered in iron oxides, but the red coloration is most likely due to tholins instead.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Mracksis_InSpaceLow = This dwarf planet has a surface covered in large craters, and the red tholin compounds seem to be scattered haphazardly across it, like a sprinkling of brown sugar on a delectable sweet treat. Mmm...
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Flake_InSpaceHigh = Flake appears to be little more than a collection of snowflakes. It's possible this is a captured comet.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Flake_InSpaceLow = This object's fluffy, low-density surface probably doesn't have much in the way of gravity. At least its icy surface makes for a nice compliment to Mracksis' reds and grays.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Ervo_InSpaceHigh = Ervo shines with a strange pale blue light. It does appear to have an atmosphere!
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Ervo_InSpaceLow = The surface of Ervo is desolate. Dark gray hills and mountains are contrasted dramatically by what appear to be seas of liquid something-or-other. Oxygen? No, surely not...
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Archae_InSpaceHigh = Archae's dark gray surface seems to be composed mostly of the same stuff as Ervo. The dark object was only discovered because it would cause Ervo to periodically dim as it orbited.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Archae_InSpaceLow = This little moon isn't really so ominous. Its similar coloration to Ervo suggests the two share a common origin.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Soden_InSpaceHigh = After taking photos of Soden, you turn the craft around and instead find Kerbin. At the maximum possible magnification, in favorable conditions, Kerbin can sometimes be resolved as a single, pale blue pixel; scarcely distinguishable from Urlum. From this distant vantage point, it might not appear of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. This image encapsulates the entirety of our species' achievement; a literal representation of how far we've come. Soden rests on the precipice of eternity; it represents the farthest we can possibly go within any semi-reasonable span of time using the technology we have. Arriving here took cooperation from the engineers and scientists of many different nations, and it was our collective will to explore in the name of science and discovery that fueled this mission, moreso than any physical propellant. This point of pale light is a profound reminder of all the petty hatreds and conceits Kerbalkind has overcome to get here. As always, the future is uncertain- but if we can reach Soden, we can do anything. Whatever challenges come next, we will face them together- not as a collection of nations, but as a species. After this mission is over, we can take a moment and- finally- rest easy.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Soden_InSpaceLow = The exposure times have to be extremely long to get any visible data, and the telescope has to track the surface as it orbits, but what you get are images of a vast, desolate, and mostly craterless surface. Out here, objects are so far apart that it would take billions of years for something like Soden to begin resembling the Mun.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Lon_InSpaceHigh = Little Lon probably hasn't changed very much since Kerbol was a young star, much like Soden. This tiny world is Soden's only companion in the cosmic infinity, and when Soden leaves the inner system and travels out to aphelion, they will be two of the loneliest objects in the entire Universe.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_scopeScan_Lon_InSpaceLow = Lon's surface is mildly shiny, a little bit more than expected- so exposure times don't have to be quite as long. If you were to try imaging Lon while Soden was closer to aphelion though, you would probably fail outright. By then, these two must get virtually no light at all.
		
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Edas_InSpace = Edas appears to be a typical stony asteroid in terms of composition.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Vant_InSpace = Composition of Vant seems consistent with stony asteroids in most regions, however the dark patches appear to be carbonaceous; likely deposited here by impacts.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Zore_InSpace = Perhaps it was obvious, but while Vant's surface does have a thin layer of rock coating it, much of the object is metallic in composition. This thin rocky layer could be the last remnants of a mantle.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_LintMikey_InSpace = 68P's two bodies appear largely similar in composition; both being made up mostly of volatiles with rocks and clays spread throughout.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Crokslev_InSpaceHigh = Crokslev's two thin rings are easy to mistake for one ring without looking closely. Spectroscopic analysis indicates that they have a much icier composition than Crokslev itself.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = The surface of Crokslev proper is still fairly icy, but many regions indicate a largely stony composition, implying that the body as a whole is made up of a relatively even mix.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Geito_InSpace = Appearances can be deceiving. Not so for Geito- it really is more or less a colossal snowball. Its spectra reveals that the vast majority of its surface is ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Havous_InSpaceHigh = Havous' odd shape is compounded even further by its striking rings, and strange dark scar. Preliminary analysis indicates the rings are mostly made of ice, and the scar seems to be rockier than the rest of Havous' icy surface.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Havous_InSpaceLow = The multispectral analysis shows a largely icy world, with its darkest, greenest regions seemingly comprised of a type of beryl.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Kal_InSpace = Kal is mostly made up of dirty ice, with the brightest material evidently having been accreted from Havous' rings.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_KiKi_InSpace = Ki'Ki's reddish surface seems to have been colored this way by tholin compounds, organic molecules which are the result of hydrocarbons reacting with solar wind and cosmic rays.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mracksis_InSpaceHigh = Initial analysis has eliminated the possibility of iron causing Mracksis' red color. We never really expected it to have any iron, but it's always important to falsify your hypotheses. Instead, it's because of tholins again. Always those dang tholins! 
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Mracksis_InSpaceLow = We never saw these dark gray regions from Kerbin due to the sheer distance and small size of Mracksis. They appear to get their color from dirty ices.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Flake_InSpace = Much like a snowflake, Flake is composed largely of water ice. There is little else to speak of here. The color kind of reminds you of Vall. It's possible Flake could've once been a comet before being captured by Mracksis; or it may have formed alongside Mracksis and could become a comet if something kicks it out of orbit eventually.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Ervo_InSpaceHigh = Initial spectroscopy confirms our wildest dreams about Ervo have indeed come true; it has an atmosphere! An extremely thin one, but an atmosphere nonetheless. Composition appears to be a rather even mix of oxygen and nitrogen.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Ervo_InSpaceLow = Scans of the surface show large pale blue regions that are unmistakably liquid oxygen. Ervo is an incredibly alien world- truly, truth is often stranger than fiction.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Archae_InSpace = Colored similarly to Ervo in visible light, Archae's composition is similar too- being mostly made of various ices and traces of rock.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Soden_InSpaceHigh = Even this sensitive instrument can't pinpoint Soden from such an extreme distance. You'd be better off waiting until you get into low orbit, which should be... HOW LONG FROM NOW?!
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Soden_InSpaceLow = Soden's icy surface is barely visible in the dim light from Kerbol, but its pinks and reds do appear to be the result of tholin compounds on its surface. A more comprehensive analysis will be required to determine why it's distributed so unevenly over its surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmImagingPlatform_Lon_InSpace = Bizzarely, Lon appears to be covered in traces of several rare metals; most notably gold. This raises more questions than answers. Perhaps Lon was a rogue object from another star system that Soden happened to capture?
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Edas_InSpaceLow = It's a rock.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Vant_InSpaceLow = Rock.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Zore_InSpaceLow = It's a chunk of metal. No aliens here.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = Hmm. This sure is a comet. It sure doesn't produce radio waves.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = That's no dwarf planet...
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Geito_InSpaceLow = Snowballs don't emit radio waves.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Havous_InSpaceLow = SPEEN!
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Kal_InSpaceLow = Maybe you can still catch the latest headball game from all the way out here?
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_KiKi_InSpaceLow = Silence...
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Mracksis_InSpaceLow = For some reason, prior to this mission's arrival at Mracksis there was a popular conspiracy theory that Mracksis was actually a giant organism from another star, bent on infesting Kerbin with its gross yuckiness. You aren't sure what kind of nightmares that idea came from, but thankfully Mracksis is just an ordinary dwarf planet with no weird radio signals.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Flake_InSpaceLow = This little snowball emits about as many radio waves as the one you picked up outside the Space Center last winter.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Ervo_InSpaceLow = Ervo actually gives off detectable radio activity, as its rarefied atmosphere interacts with the solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Archae_InSpaceLow = If Archae was made of kaquadah, maybe it would emit radio waves or something, but kaquadah is a fictional substance from Spacegate, so...
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Soden_InSpaceLow = So far from Kerbol, the radio activity produced by our home star has begun to blend in with the interstellar background- which produces a vibrant tapestry of faint signals from countless stars, both nearby and distant. Out here, our sun is nigh-indistinguishable from the infinity that surrounds it.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSIGINT_Lon_InSpaceLow = As with Soden, there is no appreciable activity coming from Lon, but the interstellar medium is producing radio signals unlike anything we could've detected from Kerbin. Some of these signals even seem unusually organized... Perhaps they are distant pulsars, or... something else?
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Edas_InSpaceLow = High-resolution imaging of Edas reveals its cratered surface in great detail. You're not sure the general public will care about an asteroid, though.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Vant_InSpaceLow = Vant's heavily cratered surface indicates a long history of impacts. Given its presence in the asteroid belt, this is unsurprising.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Zore_InSpaceLow = Zore's rugged, tough surface is covered in rubble. Some of the lowest regions appear to reflect sunlight like dirty metal.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = This contact binary comet has a mostly lumpy surface with few indications of impacts; which makes sense given its lack of gravioli.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = Crokslev's surface is oddly warped, possibly by volcanic activity- but a giant impact crater in the northern hemisphere gives it a strong resemblance to a planet-busting superweapon from the popular sci-fi film franchise, Space Wars. This is gonna be great for PR.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Geito_InSpaceLow = Geito resembles a giant snowball quite closely, but from up close, its low-gravity, fluffy surface is unlike anything seen on Kerbin. Massive ice crystals characterize it, and some of these are even clear enough to see right through.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Havous_InSpaceLow = It looks like someone took the Mun and squished it. There are definitely fewer craters though, most likely because of the very low density of potential impactors this far from Kerbol.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Kal_InSpaceLow = A band of bright material around the equator was probably accreted from Havous' rings over a long time. Besides a few craters though, there isn't much else to see.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_KiKi_InSpaceLow = This dark reddish-brown contact binary could have once been a comet. Its lumpy, tholin-covered surface will give the scientists a lot to study, but it's not very interesting to the public.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Mracksis_InSpaceLow = Perhaps these images will finally dispel the crazy rumors about Mracksis being a hostile alien lifeform the size of a dwarf planet. Seriously, what the heck is that about?
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Flake_InSpaceLow = Flake almost looks like a tiny version of Vall, with its bumpy surface and blue tint.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Ervo_InSpaceLow = Ervo glows faintly in the dim sunlight, a product of its thin atmosphere. You can additionally see that the object is actually covered in many faint craters that were barely visible to other imaging devices.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Archae_InSpaceLow = Archae looks somewhere between Minmus and the Mun in terms of size, but its many craters cause it to visually resemble the Mun far more. This small, dark object is hard to image without frustratingly long exposure times.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Soden_InSpaceLow = These images will take a while just to be transmitted back home, but when they arrive they will no doubt capture the imaginations of the public. Despite Soden's small size, its sheer distance from Kerbol cannot be overstated, and the accomplishment of getting here will surely interest even those who don't normally appreciate how fascinating dwarf planets can be.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmReconScan_Lon_InSpaceLow = Lon is a tiny yellowish lump of rock and ice orbiting the farthest known dwarf planet in the Kerbol system. Its surface doesn't really look very interesting to be honest, but the accomplishment of getting these pictures is reason enough to be proud. We've really conquered our solar system, haven't we? We've come a long way since the days of strapping a control part and some Goo to an SRB and letting it fly. Whatever comes next from here, you're sure it will be awesome.
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Edas_SrfLanded = Surface hydrogen content is minimal here. It's just rocks and rocks, and more rocks.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Vant_SrfLanded = It's still just rocks.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Zore_SrfLanded = Metallic rocks.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_LintMikey_SrfLanded = 68P's surface is covered in volatiles, many of which are rich in hydrogen.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Crokslev_SrfLanded = The presence of hydrogen confirms that Crokslev has an abundance of water ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Geito_SrfLanded = Like other comets, Geito is very icy and so the instrument gets a strong neutron signal.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Havous_SrfLanded = Havous is icy, similar to most other objects so far from Kerbol.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Kal_SrfLanded = The surface of Kal produces a strong neutron signal, indicating it's mostly made of water ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_KiKi_SrfLanded = The strong response detected by the instrument is probably due to tholin compounds, in addition to ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Mracksis_SrfLanded = The dark surface of Mracksis is loaded with hydrogen, mostly in the form of water ice and complex organic compounds called tholins.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Flake_SrfLanded = Flake is much like a comet in terms of its water content, so the sensor gets a strong positive response.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Ervo_SrfLanded = Ervo's dark surface is apparently quite icy, and a lot of that ice is definitely water.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Archae_SrfLanded = Archae appears to share many things in common with Ervo, including its abundance of water ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Soden_SrfLanded = Soden's surface produces a strong signal for the instrument to detect no matter where you go- it's very icy, and dusted with tholins all over.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmNAlbedoScan_Lon_SrfLanded = Lon is not as icy as one might expect. In fact, the water ice content of this small object is rather low in places. This suggests a very unusual composition for an object in this region of space. Perhaps it was captured from interstellar space...?
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Edas_SrfLanded = Analysis of the surface here reveals iron and magnesium silicates and traces of metallic iron, an unusually usual composition for an S-type asteroid. It would appear that Edas is the origin of many chondrite asteroids found on Kerbin. Neato!
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Vant_SrfLanded = Vant's surface is typical for a stony asteroid, so there isn't much to say here. You've got your iron and magnesium silicates, your metallic iron... This detailed analysis does, however, allow us to more accurately determine which meteorites found on Kerbin originate from Vant.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Zore_SrfLanded = This sample proved challenging to procure for the drill, which is designed for softer, less metallic rock. Below the layer of rock on Zore's surface is a densely packed, monolithic chunk of almost pure iron and nickel. It would appear that Zore is indeed the exposed core of an ancient protoplanet.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_LintMikey_SrfLanded = The surface of this tiny comet is highly varied in composition, ranging from water ice to rock and clay.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Crokslev_SrfLanded = Crokslev has an icy surface, dirtied by rock and clay. It somewhat resembles a comet, actually.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Crokslev_SrfLandedPoles = It would appear that Crokslev's poles are more covered in rock and clay than water ice.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Crokslev_SrfLandedOriginCrater = The composition below the surface here reveals foreign material embedded in the ground, likely placed here by the impactor.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Crokslev_SrfLandedCratersBigCrater = Ice here seems to have been melted and then re-frozen rapidly, looking a lot like an icy version of impact glass.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Geito_SrfLanded = Geito's fluffy surface is almost entirely made up of water ice. With little else to find even several meters below, it's no wonder the object is uniformly white in color.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Havous_SrfLanded = Though Havous' surface is covered in a layer of ice, a few meters down more silicates are detected than expected. It's still mostly ice, though.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Havous_SrfLandedScar = This dark scar seems to have revealed a rocky inner layer of Havous, explaining its color. Analysis of the sample shows several types of beryl are present here, which helps to explain its strong green tint.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Havous_SrfLandedGlaciersMontesTimor = This region is predominantly ice, suggesting that some sort of geological process has filtered out the rocky material.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Kal_SrfLanded = Below the surface, Kal appears to be made up of a variety of rock, ice, and metallic material.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_KiKi_SrfLandedContactPoint = This region is very dense, but the drill powers through it anyway. The composition here consists of the same water ice and tholins found elsewhere on Ki'Ki.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_KiKi_SrfLanded = Ki'Ki's dark reddish surface is dominated by water ice and tholins. Both lobes appear to have the same composition, implying they formed in the same region in the same conditions.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Mracksis_SrfLanded = The surface of Mracksis is covered in large quantities of tholins, but since they form due to solar wind and cosmic rays, the region below the surface is mostly made of water ice and simple organic molecules; the kind that usually form tholins.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Mracksis_SrfLandedMaria = This region is more rocky than most of Mracksis, but the rock appears to have come from an impactor, and not from Mracksis' interior.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Mracksis_SrfLandedIceFields = This dark, icy feature could have formed from an impact, rather than geological activity. You'd like to get the expert opinion of a xenogeologist on that.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Mracksis_SrfLandedPlanitiaLesserMare = The surface here is as rich in tholins as most other places on Mracksis, but it seems to have been heated and compressed; likely by an impact.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Flake_SrfLanded = The loosely-associated, fluffy surface of Flake is rather like that of a comet, in structure and in composition. This sample is mostly loosely-packed water ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLanded = Ervo's surface is actually not all ice- though on this world, water acts much like rock, actual proper rock is still present here in significant amounts.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLandedOxygenLakes = The surface here is wet with liquid oxygen, and even contains oxygen ice, a bizarre concept indeed. The drill has thankfully been treated in preparation for this exact scenario, so it doesn't rust, but if you keep taking samples here it just might.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLandedCoastalBasins = It's tough to tell, but the sample appears to indicate this was once an oxygen sea, judging by the salt deposits on the surface. Ervo's liquid oxygen oceans seem to be disappearing rapidly- at least, rapidly on a geological timescale.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLandedImpactBasin = This area contains traces of rusted metal, as well as an abundance of oxygen ice. If the impactor was some sort of comet or comet-like object rich in oxygen ice, it could explain how Ervo got its abundance of oxygen.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLandedMountains = The volcanic rock here is comparatively recent. It appears that Ervo is still geologically active! Perhaps tidal forces from Archae are keeping its mantle liquid?
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Ervo_SrfLandedGlacierFields = The ice several meters down is extremely dense. It seems these glaciers may have formed from a large underground ocean in the area.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Archae_SrfLanded = Archae's subsurface composition is varied, consisting of a majority water ice, with a large rocky component and traces of various metals.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Soden_SrfLanded = Tholin compounds are sprinkled over the water ice here, creating a pinkish substance that is unlike anything you've ever seen before.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Soden_SrfLandedTigerStripes = These appear to be ancient flows from long-dead cryovolcanoes, though their exact location is no longer clear.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Soden_SrfLandedGlaciersAll = This dark region is covered in a variety of tholins, some dark red and others a strange shade of purple.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Soden_SrfLandedMajorCanyons = Below the surface, this region is mostly comprised of water ice.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Soden_SrfLandedMinorCanyons = Deep below, a variety of ices including water ice and ammonia ice are present here.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmXRayDiffract_Lon_SrfLanded = In a very unexpected turn of events, Lon is rather poor in water ice, and is instead rich in silicates and rare metals, including gold. This is a very unusual composition for an object in this part of space.
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Edas_SrfLanded = Edas has a very typical siliceous composition, consistent with the chondrite meteorites that are common on Kerbin.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Vant_SrfLanded = Vant's surface is siliceous, like other S-type asteroids. The chemical analysis matches similar tests done on certain meteorite families on Kerbin, indicating that some of those originated right here!
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Zore_SrfLandedRocky = This area of Zore is primarily rocky in composition, specifically olivine. The nature of this layer suggests it may the the last remnant of Zore's ancient mantle, and strongly indicates it used to be a much larger body.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Zore_SrfLandedMetal = The surface here is mostly metallic; only small traces of olivine dust are detected in the chemical analysis. Its iron-nickel composition lends a lot of weight to the theory that Zore is the core of a long-dead protoplanet.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_LintMikey_SrfLanded = 68P's surface is mostly icy, with rocks and clays scattered throughout which give it its reddish-brown tint.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLanded = The surface of Crokslev is mostly water ice, with traces of rock and clay giving it that dark gray coloration.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLandedPoles = Crokslev's polar regions seem to be more rocky than icy. There's actually very little water ice here.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLandedBigCrater = This crater contains rock dust of a different composition than the rest of Crokslev, likely originating from the impactor.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLandedOriginCrater = The composition of the icy dust in this crater matches that of Crokslev's rings. This implies that the object which formed this crater also created the rings.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLandedCentralPeak = This mound at the center of the crater is more icy than dusty, which indicates that much of the material spread out by the impactor is still here.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Crokslev_SrfLandedCraters = Traces of foreign material hint as to the composition of the object that formed this crater.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Geito_SrfLanded = Surface composition here is about what you'd expect from a comet; it's ice and not much else.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Havous_SrfLanded = Havous' surface is mostly icy, but most areas contain significant traces of rock.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Havous_SrfLandedScar = Unlike the rest of Havous, this massive scar is largely rocky in composition. The chemical analysis suggests it may be beryl.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Havous_SrfLandedPointZero = The location and rocky composition of this mound suggests that this was the point of impact, making Mare Transformatio actually an enormous impact crater.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Havous_SrfLandedGlaciers = This region is almost exclusively made up of ice. It's possible the ice originates from an ocean buried deep below.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Kal_SrfLanded = Kal has a mostly icy surface, tinted dark gray by a layer of rock residing just below.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Kal_SrfLandedPeaks = This bright, soft, icy material seems to have been accreted from Havous' rings.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_KiKi_SrfLanded = The chemical analysis shows an abundance of water ice and organic molecules known as tholins, the latter of which gives Ki'Ki its red color.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Mracksis_SrfLanded = This red ground appears to be made up of densely packed tholins, organic molecules formed by reactions with the solar wind and cosmic rays.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Mracksis_SrfLandedIce = This part of Mracksis is mostly composed of water ice and rock, lacking the tholins which give other areas their red color.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Flake_SrfLanded = Flake has a fluffy layer of icy regolith coating its exterior. Below that though, there's just more ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLanded = The surface of Ervo is both very icy and very rocky. It appears to be made of a fairly even mix of both.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLandedOxygenLakes = The laser's heat causes the liquid oxygen to react, damaging the equipment!
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLandedPoles = Ervo's poles are coated in a dense layer of water and oxygen ice. Blasting the oxygen ice causes a bright reaction. It may be best to turn the power of the laser down a bit.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLandedImpactBasin = The abundant water and oxygen ice in this basin seems to suggest that it's an impact crater, and potentially the origin of Ervo's oxygen abundance.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLandedMountains = The laser reveals this area is mostly rocky, and said rock is relatively young, too. This seems to show that Ervo is still geologically active.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfLandedGlaciersAll = Heating the oxygen ice here causes a reaction with Ervo's atmosphere, forming nitrous oxide.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Ervo_SrfSplashed = The liquid oxygen combusts violently, damaging the instrument! Perhaps this wasn't the best idea.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Archae_SrfLanded = Archae's surface is mostly water ice, with large quantities of rock spread throughout. There are also traces of various metals.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Soden_SrfLanded = The pinkish, snow-like surface here is mostly water ice, tinted slightly by a light sprinkling of tholin compounds. The resulting surface structure is unlike anything we've ever encountered before, even on other outer solar system bodies.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Soden_SrfLandedGlaciersAll = The tholins here have a wide range of colors, but the majority are deep maroon and purple.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Soden_SrfLandedMajorCanyons = Below the powdery layer of tholins, a thick layer of water ice exists.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Soden_SrfLandedMinorCanyons = Beneath the light, snow-like layer of tholins is a layer of several ices, including nitrogen and water ice, with traces of oxygen ice as well.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Soden_SrfLandedTigerStripes = The darker color here seems to be due to a layer of water ice, frozen over the existing ice and tholins below. This may be the site of an ancient cryovolcanic flow.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmlaserblastscan_Lon_SrfLanded = Surprisingly, Lon is lacking in water ice, and appears to be a primarily rocky, metallic body. Gold is present here. This is perplexing, indeed- it defies our understanding of how objects form in this region of space, implying it didn't originate here. Could Lon have been captured from interstellar space...?
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Edas_InSpace = Edas does not appear to significantly affect the particle situation in this region of space.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Vant_InSpace = Vant isn't giving off anything that the sensors pick up, so you just get the usual readings from solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Zore_InSpace = Emitting particles is not on the long list of Zore's interesting qualities, so the wafers simply collect solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_LintMikey_InSpaceHigh = At this distance, all the sensor can pick up is solar wind.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = As 68P nears perihelion, it begins to outgas as a tail is formed. This generates plenty of ionized ice, clay and rock particles for the wafers to collect and study.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Crokslev_InSpaceHigh = Passing near Crokslev's rings reveals a mostly icy composition, especially in the brighter outer ring. The dark inner ring contains more mixed materials, and may represent material ejected from Crokslev itself during the impact event that formed the rings.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = Down close to Crokslev, not much of note is detected besides the odd ice particle, no doubt having been kicked out of the rings by some obscure force.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Geito_InSpaceHigh = So far from Geito, the ion concentrator can only detect solar wind particles.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Geito_InSpaceLow = As Geito passes close to Kerbol, it starts forming a tail, and the collectors detect numerous charged water molecules and traces of other elements.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Havous_InSpaceHigh = At this altitude, only the solar wind can be detected. But if you get closer, the instrument should be able to conduct a detailed survey of Havous' rings.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Havous_InSpaceLow = Havous' dramatic rings give the collectors plenty of material to study. It would appear that they are largely icy in composition, which helps to explain how bright they are. The inner, blue-est ring is more rocky, appearing to be made of beryl dust- probably kicked into orbit by the impact that disfigured Havous.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Kal_InSpace = Some traces of water ice seem to have been collected from Havous' rings, and are currently orbiting Kal itself. It's much too thin to be visible, but this could be considered a ring of sorts as well.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_KiKi_InSpace = Ki'Ki doesn't affect the particle composition of space in this region much. If it used to be a comet, maybe there was a point where it would have done so.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Mracksis_InSpace = Nothing unusual is detected in the collectors in orbit of Mracksis.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Flake_InSpace = Though Flake looks much like a comet, it doesn't have a tail, so the wafers don't collect much other than the solar wind.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Ervo_InSpaceHigh = Space high over Ervo is much like anywhere else at this solar altitude- dark, cold, with extremely sparse solar wind.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Ervo_InSpaceLow = Traces of nitrogen and oxygen are detected by the instrument, likely originating from Ervo's thin atmosphere. Many of these particles have been charged by their interactions with the sparse solar wind. Though, so far from Kerbol, maybe it'd be more apt to call it a solar breeze.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Archae_InSpace = Archae does not affect the types of particles collected by the wafers.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Soden_InSpaceHigh = Well outside of Kerbol's heliopause, space around Soden is unlike anywhere else in the solar system. Are we even still IN the solar system? Does this count? Either way, the wafers detect extremely faint traces of solar wind from distant, distant stars- some of which are probably long dead. This will give the lab boys a lot to think about.
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Soden_InSpaceLow = Small traces of water ice are detected here. This doesn't make sense unless Soden still has traces of cryovolcanic activity, though little evidence of this remains on the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSolarParticles_Lon_InSpace = Lon doesn't do anything that the solar particle collector can detect.
	
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Edas_InSpaceLow = Edas appears devoid of water, judging by the microwave scans.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Vant_InSpaceLow = Vant is not as dry as most stony asteroids. The microwave signals would suggest that water ice is present in some regions, mostly below the surface and at the poles.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Zore_InSpaceLow = Zore is as dry as a bone. Drier, actually.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_LintMikey_InSpaceLow = 68P is a comet, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that it's quite wet.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Crokslev_InSpaceLow = Crokslev appears to be abundant in ice, according to these readings.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Geito_InSpaceLow = Like most comets, Geito is mostly water ice, so it emits a strong signal for the antenna to detect.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Havous_InSpaceLow = A strong signal coming from Havous and its rings suggests that both are rich in water, and the former may even have liquid oceans beneath the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Kal_InSpaceLow = Kal seems to be quite icy, much like its parent body.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_KiKi_InSpaceLow = Like comets, Ki'Ki seems to have an abundance of water ice.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Mracksis_InSpaceLow = Mracksis gives off a strong signal indicating massive quantities of water ice, both on and below the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Flake_InSpaceLow = Flake's composition is probably mostly ice, judging by its color and the data provided by the antenna.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Ervo_InSpaceLow = Ervo is quite wet indeed, though perhaps not as much as one might expect. It's probable that rock is a major component of Ervo's interior makeup.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Archae_InSpaceLow = Archae is not as icy as expected. The response is still fairly strong, but it seems to be a bit less icy than Ervo. If it formed alongside Ervo, this may imply that the parent body received a large donation of ice from an impactor, possibly the same one that gave it so much oxygen.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Soden_InSpaceLow = Soden is an icy object indeed, but the microwave environment of the space around it is arguably even more interesting. Outside of the heliopause, there is little to protect Soden or this craft from the interstellar medium.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmSoilMoisture_Lon_InSpaceLow = You double-check the data, and confirm that it does seem to be accurate- Lon is very much lacking in ice. This is puzzling...
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Edas_InSpaceHigh = Albedo is consistent with other stony asteroids. Edas is proving to be quite typical for an S-type asteroid.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Vant_InSpaceHigh = Vant's albedo varies by as much as 20% depending on the area being focused on, indicating a varied surface composition.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Zore_InSpaceHigh = Zore's albedo is quite low; as expected for a metallic object like this.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_LintMikey_InSpaceHigh = Analysis of 68P's spectra reveals its brownish-red color is most likely caused by the presence of rock and clay.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Crokslev_InSpaceHigh = Crokslev's dark surface absorbs UV in a manner consistent with icy objects, but its low overall albedo also suggests the presence of rock in large quantities.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Geito_InSpaceHigh = Geito absorbs UV quite strongly, indicating a mostly icy composition.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Havous_InSpaceHigh = Havous' bright surface suggests the presence of water ice, as well as various silicates. When the scar passes in sunlight, albedo drops dramatically and the spectral analysis indicates the presence of beryl on the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Kal_InSpaceHigh = Kal is a dark object with an apparently mixed composition, according to analysis of reflected light.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_KiKi_InSpaceHigh = Ki'Ki's spectra very closely resembles that of some comets, with the spectral analysis showing an abundance of tholins and water ice on its surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Mracksis_InSpaceHigh = Mracksis' albedo is overall quite low, but it fluctuates significantly depending on which regions are in the sun.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Flake_InSpaceHigh = Flake's surface is shiny in visible spectra but absorbs most UV light, indicating its surface is icy.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Ervo_InSpaceHigh = Spectroscopic analysis of Ervo from high orbit indicates the object has a dark surface that absorbs most wavelengths, but its nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is very bright by comparison.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Archae_InSpaceHigh = This dark little object absorbs light in many spectra, but UV absorption is not as high as expected. This implies it may not be as icy as its parent.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Soden_InSpaceHigh = Soden's surface ranges from very bright to very dark, though in this light it can be difficult to tell the difference. Initial analysis confirms an abundance of tholins on the surface, in many varieties.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmRadiometerScan_Lon_InSpaceHigh = Lon is comparatively rather bright in the visual spectrum. Oddly, absorption patterns seem to rule out an icy composition.
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Edas_SrfLanded = The scan reveals that Edas is a monolithic object, held together more by structural forces than gravity.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Vant_SrfLanded = Scans of Vant's interior indicate it possesses a small iron-nickel core, and a thick mantle of olivine.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Zore_SrfLanded = Zore's interior resonates like a giant chunk of metal, and the analysis seems to confirm that the object is indeed the leftover core of a protoplanet.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_LintMikey_SrfLanded = 68P's loose surface does not transmit seismic waves- at all, really- and the hammer accomplishes basically nothing.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Crokslev_SrfLanded = Seismic analysis shows that Crokslev's interior is mostly undifferentiated, and its structure varies little with depth.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Geito_SrfLanded = Geito's icy, low-density surface proves impossible to analyze with this instrument.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Havous_SrfLanded = The hammer's waves transmit well throughout the interior of Havous, giving you a wealth of information to process about its complex interior makeup. Preliminary analysis shows that there are several possible underground oceans.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Kal_SrfLanded = Kal's interior appears to be more rocky than icy. Most of the ice is found on the surface, especially in the equatorial peaks.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_KiKi_SrfLanded = Ki'Ki is too soft for seismic waves to give the sensors any useful data.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Mracksis_SrfLanded = Mracksis' interior grows more rocky the deeper you look. This data may even contain evidence of a solid metallic core.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Flake_SrfLanded = Flake's comet-like structure renders a tool like this largely useless.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Ervo_SrfLanded = Scans of Ervo's interior bring about a startling revelation: It's still geologically active! Its mantle appears to be molten, and material still shifts and flows below the surface. How it has remained active for so long isn't clear, but Archae may have something to do with it.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Archae_SrfLanded = Archae's interior is made up of mostly rocky material, with scattered patches of water ice spread throughout- most of it near the surface.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Soden_SrfLanded = Seismic scans of Soden reveal an interior shaped by cryovolcanism, and there's evidence to suggest that limited activity is ongoing.
		
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmseismicHammer_Lon_SrfLanded = Lon's interior doesn't reflect seismic waves like an icy object is expected to. These readings have more in common with rocky bodies found in the inner solar system, suggesting that Lon arrived here from elsewhere.
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Ervo_SrfSplashedOxygenLakesShallow = Ervo's liquid oxygen seas would have normally damaged the instrument, if it hadn't been modified for this mission profile specifically. The temperature is seriously frigid, as expected- but there are no signs of life.
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmbathymetryscan_Ervo_SrfSplashedOxygenLakesDeep = The deepest parts of Ervo's seas are even colder than the shallower regions, and just as lifeless. Down here, it is an extremely dark, alien environment.
	
	
		#LOC_MPE_DMSciDef_dmbiodrillscan_Ervo_SrfLanded = Ervo's icy surface shows no signs of life. There is nothing suggesting biological activity in this core sample.
