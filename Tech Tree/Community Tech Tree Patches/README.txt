These are custom patches which are meant to integrate SunkWorks, DeepFreeze, and WarpDrive into Community Tech Tree in a more specific way.
These configs create custom tech tree nodes with original icons and flavor text, and also support Unkerballed Start.
The SunkWorks patch also adds several smaller-scale submarine parts to flesh out the first node, allowing you to more easily design tiny submarines.
Note, however, that these new engines are balanced around the stats from SunkWorks_CheaperEngines.cfg.
