EarlierGoodLandingGear.cfg moves the LY-10 Small Landing Gear to an earlier node on the tech tree, to save you from the pain of dealing with the LY-01 and LY-05 fixed gear parts.

EarlierLadders.cfg shifts all ladders, including those added by Restock Plus, earlier on the tech tree. Why do you need to do science to learn how to make LADDERS?

EarlierMk1StructuralFuselage.cfg shifts the Mk1 structural fuselage earlier, so you can use it as soon as you unlock the MK1 jet fuel fuselage.

EarlyFuelCells.cfg shifts fuel cell technology earlier- the small one is available at game start, and the large is now part of Electrics.

StartWithStruts.cfg makes struts available at the start.

Where appliccable, all of these configs support Unkerballed Start and Community Tech Tree.
